It refers to a network of virtual worlds in the third dimension. It refers to real-time virtual worlds which you can experience in a persistent and synchronous manner. It represents a network of interconnected virtual communities where unlimited users can participate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-marketing.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Marketing"                ></p><p>Source: searchenginejournal.com</p><p>Each individual in a Metaverse environment can have a presence as well as experience data streaming live. This can pertain to objects, identity, entitlements, history, payments, and communications.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-Metaverse-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-Metaverse-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Is Metaverse Marketing?"></a>Part 2: What Is Metaverse Marketing?</h2><p>For marketers, there is much potential to explore. However, they need to understand it fully in order to know its potential to the fullest. Marketers need to understand how they can adapt as this world expands and different brands find opportunities to market and sell their products and services. In general, it is a platform suited to market to the Millenials as well as the Gen Zers. These generations are the most avid users of Metaverses. That is mainly pertaining to virtual gaming zones and technologies such as AR and VR.</p><p>Here we explore what <strong>Metaverse marketing</strong> is and what the concept means for brands as well.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-Metaverse-Mean-for-Brands-3"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-Metaverse-Mean-for-Brands-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does Metaverse Mean for Brands?"></a>Part 3: What Does Metaverse Mean for Brands?</h2><p>Metaverse is considered as a successor to what the present-day internet offers. Today mobile internet has predominance. This is a different era compared to broadband internet that came by in the nineties as well as in the early part of the new millennium.</p><p>Today there is the convergence of artificial intelligence, cloud processing as well as 5G technologies. These have been attributed to offering a cost-effective and enjoyable VR and AR experience. This is also due to increased connectivity that now exists across different devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-brand-marketing.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Brand Marketing"                ></p><p>Source: venturebeat.com</p><p>Today, the way we consume data and brands has shifted. Metaverse represents a confluence of several things, from social interactions to gaming or even the cryptocurrency universe. Metaverse attempts to blur the lines to create a reality that is used and perceived differently by different people. It sets up a democratised and decentralized space.</p><p>Brands need to remember that Metaverse puts people before. Hence, it provides them an opportunity to present their offerings in a different light or perspective. Metaverse is spaces that are characterized by playfulness, community and creation of values. Brands can embed their services and products in a creative manner in such an environment. It also gives exposure to unexplored audiences without having to worry about real-world outcomes in such an environment.</p><p>One of the pioneers to embrace this concept is Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is CEO of Facebook and he believes that it is the future path forward for his company. His enterprise is about a trillion dollars worth. He believes that it will help expand his social media platforms where people will engage more. It will combine platforms for work, play as well as a platform to socialize at. Indeed, after they changed their name to Meta, the word has been trending across internet portals. It is yet to be seen how Facebook makes the transition to Meta a successful one. This is especially because Facebook is still sorting out some PR legalities.

As such, you do not need to download anything additional to use the service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your audio across all the operating system’s apps and programs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-Fades-in-Adobe-Audition-Basics"><a href="#Mastering-Fades-in-Adobe-Audition-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Fades in Adobe Audition Basics"></a>Mastering Fades in Adobe Audition Basics</h2><p>Adobe Audition, developed by Adobe Inc is a digital audio workstation. This is a great application one can use, for sound effect designing or video podcasting, to record and&#x2F;or mix audio. Audition has two modes, accessible by clicking on the Waveform or Multitrack buttons present at the top, or by double clicking to open an audio file or multitrack session in the Files panel. Audition has several panels, each with a unique set of features.</p><p>Effects can be implemented at the same time by choosing them from the Effects menu or as a list in the Effects bar, enabling you to test with effect combinations before implementing them. Presets help you get started, and detailed controls allow you to fine-tune your adjustments. You can also batch-process audio files to remove 60 Hz hum or fit the amplitude of clips. It can be done using a variety of measures, including industry standard Broadcast Loudness options.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Adobe-Audition-Fade-In"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Adobe-Audition-Fade-In" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Adobe Audition Fade In"></a>Part 1. Steps to Adobe Audition Fade In</h2><p>The multitrack view includes a comprehensive set of non-destructive editing tools and audio mixing. The changes you make in this mode have no effect on your original audio files. You can make multiple modifications to multitrack clips immediately, making it simple to quickly adjust a mix.</p><p>Consider adjusting the level of a clip to create it more audible. In audio transitions, fading is widely used. With Fade it, the sound begins silently and slowly increases to full volume. With Adobe audition fade out, the audio begins at full volume and slightly declines to silence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/start-adobe-audition-audio-edit_.jpg"                      alt="start adobe audition audio edit"                ></p><p>If you have audio that starts quite abruptly and you’d like to add a fade, Audition makes this very easy. Here are some steps to follow:</p><ul><li>First, you have to do successful installation completion of Adobe Audition software.</li><li>Open Adobe Audition and then opt for the selection of your desired audio file. You will notice that where it is dark, you will get a square broken into 2 triangles, one at the top left and one at the top right.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/2-triangles-square.jpg"                      alt="2 triangles square"                ></p><ul><li>Now, if you point these out, you will spot them on every piece of audio you open and if you hover the mouse over that, the left one is called Fade In. The right one is Fade Out.</li><li>Now, if you pull the Heads-Up Display out of the way and click and then drag right on the icon, you will see a fade in there which is a little bit longer than you need.</li><li>If you go up to your Effects menu and go to your Amplitude and Compression section, you have got a Fade Envelope and a Gain Envelope.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/amplitude-and-compression-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="amplitude and compression adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now, if you choose Fade Envelope and of course, it is giving you the fade right the way through the audio. It will adjust for you and this is based on a Smooth Fade In.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/fade-envelop-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="fade envelop adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now, go back to the Effects, Amplitude, and Compression and Click on Fade Envelope. Then, choose a Smooth Fade Out and there you will see after zooming a little bit more, a yellow line has been drawn to show what fade effect is going to be applied.</li><li>If you click on this yellow line, you can drag it in situ and reshape it any way you want and you can create any kind of stepped fade you want.</li><li>If you go back into your effects, go back into Amplitude and Compression and this time, Choose Gain envelope. Now, you will get the yellow line flowing right the way through the audio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/gain-envelop-adobe-audition.jpg"                      alt="gain envelop adobe audition"                ></p><ul><li>Now exactly, in the same way, you can go in and begin to make adjustments. Now, when you make a selection here, Audition compresses your adjustments into that selected region. You will need to be a little careful about that when working with these effects. So, you can add fades very easily at any time by clicking on the handles at the top right and left of Waveform Display, or you can use dedicated effects for the purpose.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Audition-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-2-Audition-Alternative-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Here is a sample of how to apply vintage color grading using triadic colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/warm-color-grading-7.jpg"                      alt="different type of color grading - Triadic color grading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> As you can see, there is a lot you can achieve when using color grading.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-Chromatics-A-Practical-Approach"><a href="#Mastering-Chromatics-A-Practical-Approach" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Chromatics: A Practical Approach"></a>Mastering Chromatics: A Practical Approach</h2><p>So, you’ve heard about color theory but don’t know what it is or how to use it and you may also be wondering what color theory could possibly have to do with you. We are talking about the theory of all color combinations and how they can be altered or selected to better work together creating a more pleasant viewing for your audience.</p><p>If you are more selective with your colors in your videos or imagery the viewer will find this aesthetically pleasing and may be more engaged in your content. This includes anything from logo design all the way to props for your shot. When creating your videos within Filmora it is good practice to think about your composition in all aspects including color theory and with the guide hopefully you will have a better understanding of how you can influence your color palette.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Color-Theory"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Theory" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Theory"></a>What Is Color Theory</h2><p>Color theory consists of many elements that could fill a library on its own but for this guide we will focus on two key elements. The color wheel and color harmony. By understanding the color wheel and color harmony you can hand pick which colors to add or use in your pieces to create a well-balanced viewing experience which can help in viewer engagement and enjoyment.</p><p>There are many color wheels out there and all require understanding and research into that particular color arrangement but for this guide I will be focusing on the more widely used RGB which derives from the primary colors red green and blue, If you’re thinking why red green and blue not red yellow and blue then you are observant, while RYB is taught as the three primary colors we will be using what is known as additive primary colors of light meaning the more you add of these colors the closer to white you get, the reason we will be using this combination is due to the fact RYB misses a lot of hues around the violet area and the blue-greens meaning we achieve a higher range of color to pick from. With this in mind let’s start.</p><h2 id="The-Color-Wheel"><a href="#The-Color-Wheel" class="headerlink" title="The Color Wheel"></a>The Color Wheel</h2><p>Using red, green and blue as primary colors we can mix the colors to one another to get our secondary colors giving us yellow, magenta and cyan. We can mix these to one another to create our tertiary colors which are raspberry, orange, sprig green, turquoise, ocean and violet giving us something which looks like this</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/color-wheel.jpg"                      alt="colcor wheel"                ></p><p>As you can see, we have every color available in this wheel and they are arranged in a unison with the mixed colors starting with red, green and blue and working towards each other.</p><h2 id="Color-Harmony"><a href="#Color-Harmony" class="headerlink" title="Color Harmony"></a>Color Harmony</h2><p>So now we know how the wheel is made and what it looks like. What does it do? We can use this wheel now to gather our palette. Within color theory we talk about harmonious colors that work together in a pleasant way creating less stress on the eyes to find information in your scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-harmony.jpg"                      alt="color harmony"                ></p><p>One such harmony is complementary colors and luckily for us this is very easy to find. You take your base color and find the opposite color on the wheel. In this example the complementary color to blue is yellow depicted with a red line.</p><p>These colors always work as they create contrast and stability.</p><p>The blue lines represent what is known as split contrasting colors and these will create balance with each other.</p><p>The corners of the black rectangle land on what is known as tetradic complement and allows you to add four colors with the understanding that they will complement each other perfectly. Lastly is the purple line which represents the analogous complementary colors, you can pick these neighboring colors with the peace of mind that they will harmonize with each other. There are many more but these four are the main ones that you will use more often than any other, by selecting colors using these four main types you can create a palette for your scenes and allow the viewer to effortlessly enjoy your content. These types work no matter where you start from on the wheel so long as you keep the distances the same.</p><h2 id="But-How-Do-I-Use-This"><a href="#But-How-Do-I-Use-This" class="headerlink" title="But How Do I Use This"></a>But How Do I Use This</h2><p>You may still be unsure as to how to implement color theory into your videos. Let’s look at some scenarios that color theory may help your creations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-theory-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color theory video"                ></p><p>In this scene the director decided that the backdrop should complement the top the actor is wearing, looking at our wheel we can see the complementary color would be dark purple so they started with that, to create a more dynamic scene they then used the analogous colors of that purple being pink and red and created the backdrop. This creates a harmony within the scene and makes it effortless to see all the key elements straight away.</p><p>As you can see from this example the base color for the scene is a dark blue&#x2F;purple and using the analogous color of pink they created a point of interest within the scene that doesn’t look out of place. This is a very good way to pull the viewers eyes towards something you want them to take in above all else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/movie-cover-with-color-theory.jpg"                      alt="movie cover with color theory"                ></p><p>As you can see from all the movie covers above, they all use complementary colors from the blues to the war yellows and oranges, this creates high contrast and balance and is something done within the movie industry in every scene. It’s no coincidence that the joker is purple and green or that the iron man is red and gold, this is well prepared and researched in the planning stages of everything a visual artist creates.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>By including this into your thought process when creating videos with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will achieve well balanced and harmonious content for your viewer to enjoy and create better engagement. It’s not by chance these things happen though, it’s through research and planning that the most iconic scenes and characters are created and this is just one small brick in the foundations of content creation.

Moreover, you can opt for photography as a profession and earn unlimited monetary benefits. However, photography is not limited to capturing pictures as it only includes the editing phase.

Let’s dig into details to know more about photo editing.</p><h2 id="Part-1-10-Helpful-Tips-for-Using-Canva-Photo-Editor"><a href="#Part-1-10-Helpful-Tips-for-Using-Canva-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 10 Helpful Tips for Using Canva Photo Editor"></a>Part 1: 10 Helpful Tips for Using Canva Photo Editor</h2><p>If you have clicked a photo that does not look artistic, creative, or flawless, you can still improve the quality of your photo through exceptional photo editing.

You should look into these!</p><h3 id="1-Remove-Background"><a href="#1-Remove-Background" class="headerlink" title="1. Remove Background"></a>1. Remove Background</h3><p>The background of your image is an integral part of the portrait as it facilitates grabbing the viewer’s attention. While capturing a picture, it is possible that there are some unnecessary objects or people in the frame. Or, in some cases, the background looks dull and ruins the whole image. Canva has introduced its background remover, through which you can quickly erase the background of your picture.</p><p>Moreover, you can design or choose pre-made background templates on this tool to add a vibrant and creative background. Thus, an eye-catchy background on your pictures can make a good impression of yours. Isn’t it great?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/canva-photo-editor-tips-1.jpg"                      alt="canva ai background remover feature"                ></p><h3 id="2-Apply-Filters-by-Quick-Search"><a href="#2-Apply-Filters-by-Quick-Search" class="headerlink" title="2.

Just like other photo editors, Canva photo editor also has its exclusive filters that range in various options such as summer glow, natural tint, and many more. You can adjust the intensity of filters with your fingers and can manage their brightness, saturation, contrast, and tint effects.</p><p>Other interesting effects include BadTV, through which you can add cinematic and vintage effects to your photos by exploring different options. Thus, enhance and beautify your photos with a few swipes, and you can confidently post them across social media platforms. You should try it!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/canva-photo-editor-tips-2.jpg"                      alt="search and apply filters"                ></p><h3 id="3-Add-Text-to-Images"><a href="#3-Add-Text-to-Images" class="headerlink" title="3.

Well, the answer is yes, and here is how they differ.</p><h3 id="Color-Grading"><a href="#Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Color Grading"></a>Color Grading</h3><p>Color grading photoshop refers to the final process of content creation. It involves subtle tweaks to your photos to make them more stylish. Some of your reasons may include:</p><ul><li>Adjusting contrast so that you do not hurt your viewers’ eyes.</li><li>Color balancing</li><li>White balancing</li><li>Black leveling</li><li>Luminance adjustments</li><li>Color saturation.</li><li>Saturation</li><li>Hue</li><li>Effects and so on</li></ul><p>For example, tweaking your Instagram photo with a retro color scheme is color grading. You can achieve this by using photoshop cinematic color grading.</p><h3 id="Color-Correction"><a href="#Color-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Color Correction"></a>Color Correction</h3><p>Color correction refers to the fixes you make when creating your content. It focuses on making changes relevant to your target audience. You can do this during production from the device. For example, you can adjust your camera’s exposure when shooting your stills. As such, they appear more natural and unprocessed.</p><p>Additionally, you can do this in post-production, as the first step of your color grading photoshop process.</p><p>Some of the fixes you can do for color correction include:</p><ul><li>Eliminating dark spots and red eyes.</li><li>Changing the resolution to fit specific content. For example, you can adjust your photo to a 600 X 300 resolution to put it in a blog post.</li><li>Alternatively, you can color correct photos from different cameras to maintain consistency.

For example, you will immediately recognize a Quentin Tarantino movie thanks to the emphasis on red in his action scenes. Another example is Tyler Perry. He prefers brighter than usual color schemes.</li><li>Alternatively, you use color grading and color correction to create variation in scenes. For example, you can indicate a throwback photo by making it black and white.</li><li>Additionally, color grading photoshop is an excellent way to elicit different moods. For example, a color scheme that features bright yellows, greens, or blues can indicate different excitement levels.</li><li>Furthermore, you use color correction and color grading to indicate the importance of some scene sections. For example, news briefs are usually brighter than the rest of the shot, especially when displaying important messages, such as breaking news.</li><li>Finally, you do photoshop cinematic color grading to ensure consistency in your photos. Weather is unpredictable and can cause your scenes to vary dramatically. For example, some sections of your location may not receive similar lighting. As such, you can make those sections brighter through color grading in photoshop.</li></ul><h2 id="3-Simple-Ways-to-Color-Grading-in-Photoshop"><a href="#3-Simple-Ways-to-Color-Grading-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="3 Simple Ways to Color Grading in Photoshop"></a>3 Simple Ways to Color Grading in Photoshop</h2><p>Below are 3 simple ways to color grade in Photoshop.</p><h3 id="1-Using-Photo-Filter"><a href="#1-Using-Photo-Filter" class="headerlink" title="1.

For example, sliding it right gives you a brighter color scheme, with purple being the maximum.</li><li>Saturation: Changes here affect the density of the color you choose. For example, sliding it left makes the color less dense, giving you the most transparent shade.</li><li>Lightness: The slider affects how bright the color you choose will appear. Sliding it extremely left will make it very dark.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Using-Paint-3"><a href="#3-Using-Paint-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Using Paint"></a>3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Masterful-Marketing-Essential-Expressions-for-Professionals"><a href="#Masterful-Marketing-Essential-Expressions-for-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="Masterful Marketing: Essential Expressions for Professionals"></a>Masterful Marketing: Essential Expressions for Professionals</h2><p>If you’re not sure how to write your next marketing message, look no further. We’ve compiled a list of words and phrases that work magic in the world of advertising. You can use these words and phrases to create an effective marketing message—and increase your chances of turning first-time customers into repeat buyers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/marketing-phrase.jpg"                      alt="marketing phrase"                ></p><h2 id="1-Actionable"><a href="#1-Actionable" class="headerlink" title="1. Actionable"></a>1. Actionable</h2><p>If a word or phrase is actionable, it means that there are steps that can be taken to make it happen. For example, if you were to say “call now!”, this would not be actionable. It’s just a suggestion, or perhaps even a joke. However, if you were to say “The best way to get started with our service is by calling us at 1-800-GO-GLOVES” then this would be an actionable statement because there are specific steps involved in getting started (calling the number) and they lead directly into using the product (getting gloves).</p><h2 id="2-Free"><a href="#2-Free" class="headerlink" title="2. Free"></a>2. Free</h2><p>Free is a powerful word. Free is a word that people love to hear!</p><p>Think about it: if you’re reading this article, chances are you’ve already seen the word “free” in bold print at least once. The reason? Our brains love it so much that they don’t want us to miss anything related to free stuff!</p><p>If you’re thinking about how much more effective your marketing strategy could be if only there were some ways for people to immediately know how much value your product gives them and how quickly they can benefit from using it… well, now’s your chance!</p><h2 id="3-Limited"><a href="#3-Limited" class="headerlink" title="3. Limited"></a>3. Limited</h2><p>While it’s important to be careful not to use this word too much, you can still use it to highlight a special offer or encourage people to take action. For example: “Limited time offer.”</p><p>You may also want to consider using the phrase “Only X left!” This type of language is often used when selling products online, as it gives shoppers an idea of how many items are left and encourages them to buy quickly before they run out.</p><h2 id="4-Amazing"><a href="#4-Amazing" class="headerlink" title="4. Amazing"></a>4. Amazing</h2><p>Amazing is an adjective that can be used to describe something that is simply remarkable. The word itself conjures up feelings of awe, wonder, and surprise. If you want to convey those sentiments in your marketing, this is the word for you!</p><p>Here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li>Use it when talking about a product or service that’s so amazing it will blow away your customers’ expectations</li><li>Use it when talking about how amazed someone will be by something amazing</li><li>Use it as part of an ad headline that promises what sounds like an almost impossible feat</li></ul><h2 id="5-Bestseller"><a href="#5-Bestseller" class="headerlink" title="5. Bestseller"></a>5. Bestseller</h2><p>Bestseller. It’s the word that gets your pulse racing when you’re browsing through a bookstore, and it can make or break a book’s success. But what does “bestselling” mean?</p><p>Bestseller lists are often manipulated by publishers, who can get more favorable reviews from influential writers if they promise them higher placement on the list (or even pay for their review). And these days, there’s also serious debate about whether bestsellers truly represent what people actually want to read.</p><p>The reality is that bestsellers are subjective—their popularity depends on their category and how many copies they’ve sold in comparison to other books in that category or genre. That said, there are certain words and phrases that will make anyone sound like an authority on the subject at hand.</p><h2 id="6-Boost"><a href="#6-Boost" class="headerlink" title="6. Boost"></a>6. Boost</h2><p>Boost is a 2-word phrase that can help you make all kinds of marketing magic happen:</p><ul><li>Boost sales. Use it when you want to get people buying from your store, signing up for a webinar or other product offering, or subscribing to your newsletter.</li><li>Boost engagement. Use it when you want to get people engaging with your brand on social media and make more comments on blog posts and forum discussions.</li><li>Boost conversions—that is, the number of visitors who take action after seeing or reading something about your business (such as clicking through from an ad). Boost conversions by using this word in ads and landing pages.</li><li>Boost traffic—that is, the number of visitors coming to your site through search engines like Google or Bing; paid advertising (on Facebook or elsewhere); organic natural search results; email campaigns; etcetera!</li></ul><h2 id="7-Breakthrough"><a href="#7-Breakthrough" class="headerlink" title="7. Breakthrough"></a>7. Breakthrough</h2><ul><li>Breakthroughs are important to marketing.</li><li>Breakthroughs are important to customers.</li><li>Breakthroughs are important to the world.</li><li>Breakthroughs are important to your business.</li><li>Breakthroughs are important to your marketing and your customers too!</li></ul><h2 id="8-Complete"><a href="#8-Complete" class="headerlink" title="8. Complete"></a>8. Complete</h2><ul><li>Complete</li><li>To finish something (complete a task, to complete the work, etc.)</li><li>To do something completely (to complete your studies)</li><li>To do something in a way that is not lacking or incomplete.</li></ul><h2 id="9-Comprehensive"><a href="#9-Comprehensive" class="headerlink" title="9. Comprehensive"></a>9. Comprehensive</h2><p>A guide is a great way to help your readers understand the ins and outs of a topic, especially if you’re covering something that might have a lot of moving parts.</p><p>A review can be useful for new products or services, but it’s also helpful for existing products, like those that have recently been revamped. It helps people decide whether they want to buy the product now or wait until later when there are more reviews available.</p><p>A solution is just what it sounds like: a solution for whatever problem your audience may face with their business. If you can offer this type of solution consistently across all areas of your marketing strategy (and beyond), then you’ll build trust with your readers as an expert who understands their needs and wants to help them succeed with whatever goals they’ve set out for themselves!</p><h2 id="10-Cutting-Edge"><a href="#10-Cutting-Edge" class="headerlink" title="10. Cutting-Edge"></a>10. Cutting-Edge</h2><p>What is cutting-edge? The term “cutting edge” refers to something new and innovative. It can be used as a noun or an adjective, and it typically implies that the advertised product or service has been designed with the latest technology in mind. What does this mean for you? When you use this word in your marketing copy, it’ll show potential customers that you’re on top of what’s trending. You’ll also give them confidence that your company knows what it’s doing when it comes to providing quality products&#x2F;services at competitive prices—and maybe even provide some reassurance if they’re worried about being scammed by shady businesses!</p><p>When should I use cutting-edge?</p><p>There are many occasions when inserting “cutting-edge” into your marketing materials will benefit you enormously:</p><ul><li>When describing a product or service and its benefits (e.g., “We’ve put our clients’ needs first by developing cutting-edge solutions.”)</li><li>As part of a call-to-action (CTA) towards people who want something different—either because they want something new or because they’re bored with their current situation (e.g., “Call us today if you’re ready for a change!”).</li></ul><h2 id="11-Danger"><a href="#11-Danger" class="headerlink" title="11. Danger"></a>11. Danger</h2><p>This is a powerful word and one you can use in your marketing to describe any product, situation, or person.</p><p>Although it might sound like a simple idea at first glance, danger is actually a word that encompasses all manner of things: danger can be used to describe a product (e.g., this car is dangerous) or a situation (e.g., walking home late at night is dangerous). Danger also has an emotional charge; it evokes feelings of fear and excitement in equal measure — which makes it perfect for describing people who make us feel those emotions! You could say “dangerous” about anyone from someone who likes taking risks to the guy who works out every day at the gym. It’s not just something he does—it’s his identity!</p><h2 id="12-Effective"><a href="#12-Effective" class="headerlink" title="12. Effective"></a>12. Effective</h2><p>You can use this word to describe the results of your product or service. This is a short, sweet, and simple way to tell people what they’ll get from using your product or service. It’s also easy to understand, which makes it an effective marketing strategy. Effective is also a positive word that doesn’t include any negative connotations.</p><h2 id="13-Exclusive"><a href="#13-Exclusive" class="headerlink" title="13. Exclusive"></a>13. Exclusive</h2><p>Exclusive is a word that can be used to describe a product or service. It can also be used to appeal to your target audience, which is why it’s effective in marketing. For example, if you’re marketing a luxury car, the word “exclusive” will make people think of exclusivity and luxury. Exclusive means that something has been restricted or kept to only certain people or places; it’s something that not everyone has access to, so exclusive items are perceived as being more valuable than average ones.</p><p>It’s important for businesses trying to sell products online because using this word shows how much value they put into their products and services (and how much money they think customers will spend on them).</p><h2 id="14-Faster"><a href="#14-Faster" class="headerlink" title="14. Faster"></a>14. Faster</h2><p>Speed is a well-known concept in the marketing world. It’s often associated with companies that move quickly, and it’s often used to describe how quickly a product or service can be produced.</p><p>However, we need to take a step back and ask ourselves what speed really means. Speed isn’t just about moving fast; it’s also about making decisions rapidly, processing work quickly and efficiently, getting results fast, and implementing changes swiftly and creatively—in fact, it could be said that speed is one of the most important assets in business today.</p><h2 id="15-Fantastic"><a href="#15-Fantastic" class="headerlink" title="15. Fantastic"></a>15. Fantastic</h2><p>Fantastic is a strong word. It should be used sparingly because it can make your customers feel like they are being compared to people who don’t have such fabulous products or services.</p><p>Fantastic work best when describing products or services that really are fantastic, so don’t use it lightly!</p><h2 id="16-Free-Trial-Period"><a href="#16-Free-Trial-Period" class="headerlink" title="16. Free Trial Period"></a>16. Free Trial Period</h2><p>A free trial period is a valuable tool for your business. It gives you the opportunity to show off your product or service and help customers get a feel for how they’ll benefit from using it. The best part? You don’t have to spend any money because people are willing to try something new without paying anything upfront.</p><p>This strategy works well when you offer a risk-free opportunity for customers who might not be ready yet to buy your product or service right away but still want some time with it before committing themselves financially. People will often look at prices first, so if there are no costs associated with trying out the service before making a purchase decision, this may encourage them to take advantage of offering their free trial periods as well!</p><h2 id="17-Guaranteed-Results"><a href="#17-Guaranteed-Results" class="headerlink" title="17. Guaranteed Results"></a>17. Guaranteed Results</h2><p>Guaranteed results are powerful because they solve a problem for your customers and give them confidence in their decision to purchase. The guarantee should be specific, such as “100% Satisfaction Guarantee,” “Money Back Guarantee,” or “60-Day Money Back Guarantee.”</p><p>Your guarantee should be easy to understand and use. It’s also important that it includes the steps required to receive a refund or exchange if you don’t like what you’ve purchased. If this doesn’t make sense, ask yourself how your customers will feel when trying to take advantage of their guarantee. If there is any ambiguity or confusion about how to take advantage of their guarantee, then it needs revision or removal altogether.  </p><h2 id="18-How-To-Guide"><a href="#18-How-To-Guide" class="headerlink" title="18. How-To Guide"></a>18. How-To Guide</h2><p>How-to guides have been around as long as there have been things to learn. They’re also a great way to keep people coming back to your site because you can use them to help customers solve problems and answer questions.</p><p>When it comes down to it, how-to guides are extremely popular because they’re so easy for users to digest—and even easier for marketers and content creators like you! Let’s say you want to create a guide about how to make the perfect cup of coffee; all you need is some good research skills and some writing chops (or at least access to someone who has both).</p><p>How-to guides are also great for SEO purposes: when people search for relevant keywords or topics on Google or another search engine, they’ll likely be looking for solutions or answers that align with their needs—which means there’s an opportunity there for brands willing and ready enough.</p><h2 id="19-Increased-Revenue"><a href="#19-Increased-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="19. Increased Revenue"></a>19. Increased Revenue</h2><p>You can use the increased revenue to describe the benefits of your product or service. For example, if you’re selling a weight loss program, and your clients are losing 2 pounds per week, that’s a 20% increase in their weight loss over what they were doing before.</p><ul><li>Measure how much money you make on each sale. If it’s just $20 bucks per sale, then that means there’s room for growth! You’ve got some increasing to do!</li><li>Use terms like “increased revenue” or “revenue” when talking about sales numbers and other financial metrics at work. Your boss will be impressed by your ability - as long as he doesn’t know what those words mean!</li></ul><h2 id="20-Incredible"><a href="#20-Incredible" class="headerlink" title="20. Incredible"></a>20. Incredible</h2><p>This word is perfect to describe something that’s so hard to believe it’s almost unbelievable. You know, like when your mom asks you if you need money and you respond with “Incredibly!” Or when someone says they want to go on vacation with you, but they don’t know where or when yet. Incredibly!</p><p>You can also use it to describe something amazing. For example: “That was an incredible performance!”</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you have the best marketing words and phrases in your vocabulary, it’s time to use them! They are easy to integrate into your content as long as you keep them simple and don’t overdo it. The key is not just using these words once or twice but rather consistently throughout an entire blog post or piece of writing so that readers can really see how well they fit together with each other in a “Professional”, and “Friendly” tone.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)For macOS 10.14 or later<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-premium-android-photography-alterations/"><u>[New] Premium Android Photography Alterations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-photography-on-instagram-adding-images-made-simple/"><u>[Updated] Photography on Instagram  Adding Images Made Simple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-srt-audio-file-handling-for-oses/"><u>[New] SRT Audio File Handling for OSes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/mastering-dimming-audio-with-audacity-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Dimming Audio with Audacity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-your-sound-with-the-compreenas-complete-morphvox-guidebook/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Your Sound with the Compreenas Complete MorphVOX Guidebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-securing-yourself-from-motion-sickness-in-vr/"><u>[New] Securing Yourself From Motion Sickness in VR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/narrowing-down-dji-action-gopro-max-and-insta360-series-for-2024/"><u>Narrowing Down  DJi Action, GoPro Max, and Insta360 Series for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/obs-or-wirecast-deciding-on-the-best-streamer-tool-for-2024/"><u>OBS or Wirecast?

Given the way Microsoft has added powerful features to Photos, it has the capability to offer much more to users.

You will be able to select the speed using a slider, which lets you get the precise slow motion effect that you desire.</p><p>There is also the handy option of being able to select the portion of your video where you want to add this effect. Say you are producing a longer video, where you want the effect in place for a few seconds.</p><p>Now you can select the beginning and end point using the bottom slider on the Photos app. Choose the precise starting and ending of the slow motion effect, and then watch through your video to ensure it is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-slow-motion-microsoft-photos.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><p>We recommend that you save your video file under a new name when you are done making your desired changes. It ensures that you still have the original copy of the video saved on your computer or external hard drive.</p><p>You can even create multiple versions of the file with the slow motion effect applied in different ways.

New updates of the app always bring new features, but many users miss out on the minute new changes and feature add-ons that are meant to make the overall experience and usability a lot easier and more fun. So here is a jotted down list of the coolest <strong>WhatsApp Tricks</strong> that you may not know of yet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</a></li><li><a href="#part2">What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease</a></li></ul><h2 id="Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy"><a href="#Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy" class="headerlink" title="Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy"></a>Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</h2><p>You can do a lot of things with your WhatsApp fonts, appearance, and texts that will make your messages look oh-so-edgy! From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.</p><h4 id="1-Bold"><a href="#1-Bold" class="headerlink" title="1.Bold"></a>1.Bold</h4><p>Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic"><a href="#2-Italic" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol ( _text_ ) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough"><a href="#3-Strikethrough" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace"><a href="#4-Monospace" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options.

Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings&gt;&gt; Apps and Notifications &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp"                ></p><h4 id="7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days"><a href="#7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days" class="headerlink" title="7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days"></a>7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days</h4><p>Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option. If you enable this, your chats with the particular contact will be deleted automatically on their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-auto-delete-messages.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Auto Delete Messages"                ></p><h4 id="8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See"><a href="#8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See" class="headerlink" title="8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See"></a>8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See</h4><p>If it is annoying to open a loved one’s story and then automatically sliding into a story you did not want to open, you can MUTE the people whose stories you are not interested to see. Go to Story and tap and hold the unwanted contact to open the Mute option. Even though there is no option that you can stop the automatic carousel to the next contact’s stories altogether, you can always go by the rule of the thumb - place your thumb on the screen and the carousel won’t move.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-whatsapp-stories.jpg"                      alt="Mute Whatsapp Stories"                ></p><h4 id="9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group"><a href="#9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group" class="headerlink" title="9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group"></a>9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group</h4><p>This is as simple as it sounds.

From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.</p><h4 id="1-Bold-1"><a href="#1-Bold-1" class="headerlink" title="1.Bold"></a>1.Bold</h4><p>Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic-1"><a href="#2-Italic-1" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol ( _text_ ) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough-1"><a href="#3-Strikethrough-1" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace-1"><a href="#4-Monospace-1" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients-1"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients-1" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts-1"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts-1" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs-1"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs-1" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting-1"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting-1" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence-1"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence-1" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing-1"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing-1" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp-1"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp-1" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements-1"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements-1" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data-1"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data-1" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado-1"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado-1" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.</p><h4 id="4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords-1"><a href="#4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords-1" class="headerlink" title="4.Search Old Chats with Keywords"></a>4.Search Old Chats with Keywords</h4><p>As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats-1"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats-1" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp-1"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp-1" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it.

From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.</p><h4 id="1-Bold-2"><a href="#1-Bold-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Bold"></a>1.Bold</h4><p>Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic-2"><a href="#2-Italic-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol ( _text_ ) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough-2"><a href="#3-Strikethrough-2" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace-2"><a href="#4-Monospace-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients-2"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts-2"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs-2"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs-2" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting-2"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting-2" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence-2"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence-2" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing-2"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing-2" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp-2"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp-2" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements-2"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data-2"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado-2"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado-2" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.</p><h4 id="4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords-2"><a href="#4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Search Old Chats with Keywords"></a>4.Search Old Chats with Keywords</h4><p>As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats-2"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp-2"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp-2" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings&gt;&gt; Apps and Notifications &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp"                ></p><h4 id="7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days-2"><a href="#7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days-2" class="headerlink" title="7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days"></a>7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days</h4><p>Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized.

From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.</p><h4 id="1-Bold-3"><a href="#1-Bold-3" class="headerlink" title="1.Bold"></a>1.Bold</h4><p>Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic-3"><a href="#2-Italic-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol ( _text_ ) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough-3"><a href="#3-Strikethrough-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace-3"><a href="#4-Monospace-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients-3"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts-3"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs-3"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting-3"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting-3" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence-3"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence-3" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing-3"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing-3" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp-3"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp-3" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements-3"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements-3" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data-3"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado-3"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.</p><h4 id="4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords-3"><a href="#4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Search Old Chats with Keywords"></a>4.Search Old Chats with Keywords</h4><p>As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats-3"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp-3"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings&gt;&gt; Apps and Notifications &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp"                ></p><h4 id="7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days-3"><a href="#7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days"></a>7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days</h4><p>Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option. If you enable this, your chats with the particular contact will be deleted automatically on their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-auto-delete-messages.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Auto Delete Messages"                ></p><h4 id="8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See-3"><a href="#8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See-3" class="headerlink" title="8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See"></a>8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See</h4><p>If it is annoying to open a loved one’s story and then automatically sliding into a story you did not want to open, you can MUTE the people whose stories you are not interested to see.

At last, there was an easier way to snap images quickly, and without needing a spare finger to tap the screen. However, with this intervention also came a new problem; upside down photos.</p><p> If you’re in the habit of taking photos using your volume buttons, it feels natural to have these buttons at the top of the phone when shooting in portrait mode. After all, the shutter buttons on our digital cameras are at the top, so it’s natural to want to put the volume buttons there too. But when you shoot like this, all your images will display upside down when you upload them to your social media or laptop, if you’re a Windows user. If you use a Mac, the PC will recognize the image is upside down and will change it, but if you send that picture to a client or friend on Windows, it will, once again, be the wrong way up.</p><p> Here’s an easy way to stop taking upside down photos with your iPhone:</p><h4 id="1-Check-where-the-lens-is"><a href="#1-Check-where-the-lens-is" class="headerlink" title="1. Check where the lens is"></a>1. Check where the lens is</h4><p> Take a glance at the lens position on the back of the phone.

Check you’re not covering the lens</h4><p> Because you’re using the volume buttons in their correct position, you might be tempted to splay your fingers across the back of the phone, covering the lens.</p><p> If you’re a habitual upside-down photo-taker, it may take a little while to break this bad habit. At least now, if you do take a photo upside-down, you know how to rotate photos on iPhone using the Photos app. With a bit of practice, however, it will soon feel natural to hold the camera in its proper orientation.</p><p> iPhones are wonderful devices for budding photographers of all shapes and sizes. No other smartphone can come close to the capabilities of Apple’s iPhone in terms of picture quality, functionality and scope. By getting to know some of the hidden tricks and tools to improve your images, you’ll be the envy of every Instagrammer on the planet!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-1"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-1" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> There’s nothing more annoying than when your iPhone accelerometer decides a photo should be taken the other way around.

After all, the shutter buttons on our digital cameras are at the top, so it’s natural to want to put the volume buttons there too. But when you shoot like this, all your images will display upside down when you upload them to your social media or laptop, if you’re a Windows user. If you use a Mac, the PC will recognize the image is upside down and will change it, but if you send that picture to a client or friend on Windows, it will, once again, be the wrong way up.</p><p> Here’s an easy way to stop taking upside down photos with your iPhone:</p><h4 id="1-Check-where-the-lens-is-2"><a href="#1-Check-where-the-lens-is-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

You’ve snapped a fabulous picture of your cat&#x2F;dog&#x2F;child, but on your screen, it’s sideways and impossible to look at. Turning the phone is no use either, as it just keeps spinning the photo to the wrong orientation.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Make-Every-Moment-Count-with-These-15-Engaging-Activities-While-Listening-to-Talk-Shows"><a href="#Make-Every-Moment-Count-with-These-15-Engaging-Activities-While-Listening-to-Talk-Shows" class="headerlink" title="Make Every Moment Count with These 15 Engaging Activities While Listening to Talk Shows"></a>Make Every Moment Count with These 15 Engaging Activities While Listening to Talk Shows</h2><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening! Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do"><a href="#When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?"></a>When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?</h2><p>You do not need to dedicate a specific time to listen to podcasts. The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal" class="headerlink" title="5. Cook a meal"></a>5. Cook a meal</h3><p>Do you cook daily? Or maybe once or twice a week? Well, you can tune into your favorite episodes and cook. The best thing is if you are interested in cooking podcasts, then it is a perfect combination. Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><h3 id="6-Driving"><a href="#6-Driving" class="headerlink" title="6. Driving"></a>6. Driving</h3><p>Driving to work and from work takes a lot of time, and you often get tired of being in the car. It is best to substitute this time with your favorite podcasts daily. This way, you will be able to make the most of the time that you waste daily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="drive podcast"                ></p><p>It is important to retain that information-filled podcasts often grab all your attention, so you might focus on something other than driving itself. So, ensure that you know your routes well and listen to causal podcasts you can divert from while driving on the roads. It is best to listen to podcasts with a friend or colleague, as podcasts at such times create a perfect ebb and flow throughout the drive.</p><h3 id="7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry"><a href="#7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry" class="headerlink" title="7. Do laundry or Fold laundry"></a>7. Do laundry or Fold laundry</h3><p>Laundry can be frustrating; it is a hurtful process that even a laundry enthusiast hates to do. It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry. You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><h3 id="8-Gardening"><a href="#8-Gardening" class="headerlink" title="8. Gardening"></a>8. Gardening</h3><p>Gardening is a set of activities that often are mindless. Additionally, this is one of those activities you often have to turn to every week to ensure your plants are growing normally. You can perfectly fill these activities by tuning a podcast and making the most of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="gardening podcast"                ></p><p>Basically, if you are thinking about all the stuff to do while listening to podcasts, compile a list of mindless activities you regularly engage in and see if you can substitute such activities; in this case, gardening with podcasts should feel comfortable to you.</p><p>For instance, if you cannot focus on both, then it is best not to chase two rabbits simultaneously. The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10. Do the Dishes"></a>10. Do the Dishes</h3><p>If we have to inform this, it means you are not having fun while doing the dishes. Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12. Take a bath</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="taking a bath podcast"                ></p><p>Many people take baths for granted. It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute"><a href="#13-Commute" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home.

Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening!

The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain-1"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain-1" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently-1"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently-1" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive-1"><a href="#●-Repetitive-1" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts-1"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts-1" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch-1"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging-1"><a href="#2-Jogging-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="3-Fishing-1"><a href="#3-Fishing-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files-1"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal-1"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Cook a meal"></a>5. Cook a meal</h3><p>Do you cook daily? Or maybe once or twice a week? Well, you can tune into your favorite episodes and cook. The best thing is if you are interested in cooking podcasts, then it is a perfect combination. Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><h3 id="6-Driving-1"><a href="#6-Driving-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Driving"></a>6. Driving</h3><p>Driving to work and from work takes a lot of time, and you often get tired of being in the car. It is best to substitute this time with your favorite podcasts daily. This way, you will be able to make the most of the time that you waste daily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="drive podcast"                ></p><p>It is important to retain that information-filled podcasts often grab all your attention, so you might focus on something other than driving itself. So, ensure that you know your routes well and listen to causal podcasts you can divert from while driving on the roads. It is best to listen to podcasts with a friend or colleague, as podcasts at such times create a perfect ebb and flow throughout the drive.</p><h3 id="7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry-1"><a href="#7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Do laundry or Fold laundry"></a>7. Do laundry or Fold laundry</h3><p>Laundry can be frustrating; it is a hurtful process that even a laundry enthusiast hates to do. It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry. You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><h3 id="8-Gardening-1"><a href="#8-Gardening-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Gardening"></a>8. Gardening</h3><p>Gardening is a set of activities that often are mindless. Additionally, this is one of those activities you often have to turn to every week to ensure your plants are growing normally. You can perfectly fill these activities by tuning a podcast and making the most of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="gardening podcast"                ></p><p>Basically, if you are thinking about all the stuff to do while listening to podcasts, compile a list of mindless activities you regularly engage in and see if you can substitute such activities; in this case, gardening with podcasts should feel comfortable to you.</p><p>For instance, if you cannot focus on both, then it is best not to chase two rabbits simultaneously. The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog-1"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes-1"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Do the Dishes"></a>10. Do the Dishes</h3><p>If we have to inform this, it means you are not having fun while doing the dishes. Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails-1"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails-1" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath-1"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath-1" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12. Take a bath</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="taking a bath podcast"                ></p><p>Many people take baths for granted. It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute-1"><a href="#13-Commute-1" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home. But you’ll be amazed at how well you can adapt podcast listening while commuting in a bus or train filled with people.</p><h3 id="14-Clean-the-house-1"><a href="#14-Clean-the-house-1" class="headerlink" title="14. Clean the house"></a>14. Clean the house</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-12.jpg"                      alt="clean the house podcast"                ></p><p>Again, it all comes down to making a daunting task like cleaning the house fun and entertaining.

Haircut or hair dye"></a>15. Haircut or hair dye</h3><p>A haircut is a time that you give to your barber. It is all about sitting on the chair and letting the masters do their work. And putting on earphones for listening to music and podcast can be disastrous, as one snip and your costly earphones will be gone for good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-13.jpg"                      alt="haircut podcast"                ></p><p>However, you can make the time of everyone sitting at the saloon beautiful by simply asking the barber to play one of the podcasts they like or you like.
