Please explain to me”.</p><p>One of the fascinating aspects of technology is the never-ending innovation. However, TV terminologies can be quite confusing, that even new technologies in the industry become hard to understand.</p><p>Quantum HDR is one of the latest technologies in the TV industry that many folks still find too hard to understand.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve heard about Quantum HDR once or twice, but you still didn’t know what the technology is all about, worry less because you’ve come to the right page to find out the unknown.</p><p>Here, we’ve covered all you need to know about Quantum HDR. So it’s advisable that you read this article till the end.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Quantum HDR"></a>Part 1: What is Quantum HDR</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/quantum-hdr-everything-you-may-want-to-know-about-quantum-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="quantum hdr"                ></p><p>Just as the name suggests, Quantum HDR is a combination of two amazing technologies namely, ‘Quantum Dots and HDR (High dynamic range).</p><p>“Quantum HDR refers to TVs with a QLED screen that’s compatible with the HDR technology.”</p><p>As we all know, HDR is used to capture more details and colors in images. So, when used in TVs, it usually affects the color accuracy and contrast ratio in images. Therefore, causing an increase in color accuracy and contrast ratio.</p><p>With the presence of HDR in TVs, bright colors become brighter, and details of pictures become more visible. Yes, it does this by increasing the maximum value for three base colors ‘Red, Green, and Blue’ - this causes colors that originated from the mix of the base colors to be brighter and more saturated.</p><p>Quantum, on the other hand, means a TV uses Quantum Dot technology - a new technology used in TV screens by industry brands like Samsung to capture more details and colors in images.</p><p>Screens made of Quantum Dot technology are also referred to as QLED. Yes, this is because such screens tend to display LED lights that use a unique black light different from other TV screens. So, as a result, TVs with such screens usually have higher brightness and contrast while preserving details of the picture.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?"></a>Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?</h2><p>Quantum HDD 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x are known as peak brightness multipliers of a TV screen. Although there’s clear information about these peak brightness multipliers at this point, we could tell it’s another marketing strategy relating to how many metadata streams a TV’s processor would process to make the image displayed on its screen more detailed. For example, since the base brightness of a TV is 100 units, a Quantum HDR with a 16x peak brightness multiplier would have a peak brightness of 1,600 units, Quantum HDR with a 24x peak brightness multiplier would be 2,400 units, and so on.</p><p>In all, we could say the overall brightness of a Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x increases as the peak brightness multiplier increases.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR"><a href="#Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?"></a>Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?</h2><p>Even though Quantum HDR is a new technology, a lot of people still mistake it to be the same as HDR. So, to help clear the air on the difference between these two techniques, we’ve explained their features in the comparison table below;</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Quantum HDR</strong></th><th><strong>HDR</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Meaning</strong></td><td>Quantum HDR are TVs with QLED screen that’s compatible with HDR technology</td><td>HDR is an advanced technology that improves the quality and display signals of HDR TV (High dynamic range television)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Technology</strong></td><td>-</td><td>High dynamic range televisions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brightness</strong></td><td>Much Brighter</td><td>Much brighter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Best for</strong></td><td>Televisions</td><td>camera</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cost</strong></td><td>$1000+</td><td>$20,000+</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-and-Display-Your-HDR-Video-on-Quantum-HDR-TV"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-and-Display-Your-HDR-Video-on-Quantum-HDR-TV" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make and Display Your HDR Video on Quantum HDR TV?"></a>Part 4: How to Make and Display Your HDR Video on Quantum HDR TV?</h2><p>Truth be told, your TV won’t be able to use HDR unless you’re watching HDR-ready media - It needs a source.

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button.

But this does not mean that the Android and iOS users are not out of luck, as Telegram has a dedicated app for both of these platforms.</p><p>However, if you don’t want to install Telegram Desktop on your PC, you can use the Telegram web version instead. You can do this in two ways:</p><ul><li>By visiting the Telegram official website and start communicating directly from the browser.</li><li>By installing the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram-for-chrome/djjkifoefibfoodilnhkmbhmadbgacni" >Telegram extension on the Chrome browser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ul><p>As to the Chrome extension, it is easy for you to install it in the browser by clicking the official link given above.

However, you will see pixelated imagery when you zoom in, making it look rougher and lousy. That is a significant issue when dealing with graphical artwork or logos- a clear and crisp look is essential.</p><p>This is where <strong>vector images</strong> come in handy, a type of graphical image format that utilizes points, curves, and lines instead of a group of pixels to form the image structure. That works better for digital logos and graphic art, although slightly complex to edit.</p><p>If you want to find free <strong>vector stock images</strong>, several websites offer a rich library of these options, including other functions like editing vector images. Here is a list of the best ones you should consider seriously.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-10-websites-for-premium-quality-vector-stock-images-in-2022-1.jpg"                      alt="vector image example from vecteezy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-10-Top-Websites-with-Free-Stock-Vector-Images"><a href="#Part-I-10-Top-Websites-with-Free-Stock-Vector-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part I. 10 Top Websites with Free Stock Vector Images"></a>Part I. 10 Top Websites with Free Stock Vector Images</h2><p>Multiple <strong>free vectors websites</strong> are currently active.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

What are the types of Vector Graphic Files?</h2><p>You can use the websites mentioned in the list here to search for various vector images and get successful results. However, the need for vector images sometimes depends on their primary use to people, like printing or web design. There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.</p><ul><li><strong>.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-</strong> The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.</li><li><strong>.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-</strong> The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.</li><li><strong>PDF (Portable Document Format)-</strong> The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.</li><li><strong>.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-</strong> SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-to-Turn-to-Filmora-for-Editing-Videos-and-Adding-Graphic-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

Suppose, you wish to shoot a blooming bud or the even smaller pollens, the bugs or the worms, capturing the macro elements of nature needs a certain skill.</p><p>Shooting macro video is an art form because it requires balancing the technicalities of the camera along with the aesthetic and creative beauty of nature.</p><p>Any person having a photography background can learn the nuances of the macro video quickly as macro photohgraphy is usually a part of their subject and macro video is an extension of the same.</p><h2 id="6-Tips-For-Making-Macro-Video"><a href="#6-Tips-For-Making-Macro-Video" class="headerlink" title="6 Tips For Making Macro Video"></a>6 Tips For Making Macro Video</h2><p>The difference between the macro video and the macro photo mainly depends on the light acquisition.</p><p>You need a good amount of light in the macro photography whereas, in <a class="link"   href="http://www.uwphotographyguide.com/3-tips-underwater-macro-video" >macro video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it is not possible to have a continuous light focus on the small subject.</p><p>You may hand-hold the camera to click a macro photograph but, it is not possible in case of macro video. The 6 tips below could give you some thoughts.</p><h4 id="1-The-Importance-Of-Lighting"><a href="#1-The-Importance-Of-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="1. The Importance Of Lighting"></a>1. The Importance Of Lighting</h4><p>While shooting the depth of a subject in the macro video, proper lighting is highly essential. The object you are capturing must have a good amount of light focus on it.</p><p>But, you must be prepared to use your intelligence as well as creativity with the shooting.</p><p>For example, while shooting rare species snails that cannot be exposed to halogen light due to the heat produced by it, you can creatively use the LED lights which are cooler.</p><p>You must be careful to use the right kind of light according to your shooting subject.</p><p>Like while shooting a shiny object that can reflect the light, you may use diffusing lights by making a paper cone, focussing on the subject, and evenly directing the lights through the paper to lessen the glare while macro video shooting.</p><p>Around the lens, you may use a ring of LED lights in order to avert the incoming light while shooting a subject very closely.</p><h4 id="2-Tripod"><a href="#2-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="2. Tripod"></a>2. Tripod</h4><p>How can a tripod be helpful in capturing a macro video?</p><p>A macro video is shot from a close distance. If your camera is in motion, it can spoil your video. A tripod helps in a stable and steady macro video shoot, although being completely dependent on the tripod is not a great idea.</p><p>Try to get great visual perspectives or angles by bracing the camera on the tree or ground on any other stable object.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oconnor-ultimate-1030d-fluid-head-30l-cf-tripod.jpg"                      alt="Tripod"                ></p><h4 id="3-Background"><a href="#3-Background" class="headerlink" title="3. Background"></a>3. Background</h4><p>The background of your macro video always remains blurred as you shoot it closely. But, the background color is visible so, choosing it correctly is vital. The color of the background must compliment your composition’s color and must be chosen creatively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/separate-the-foreground-from-background.jpg"                      alt="background"                ></p><h4 id="4-DSLR-Cameras"><a href="#4-DSLR-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="4. DSLR Cameras"></a>4. DSLR Cameras</h4><p>For capturing the macro video, you can consider digital SLR camera. The macro lens of the digital SLR camera is a great option for capturing.</p><p>If you are a Canon user, you may opt for the 180 mm macro, 100 mm macro or the 65 mm MP-E lens to shoot the macro video.</p><p>You may also add an extension tube which basically splits the focal distance in two equal halves and make the image size bigger but it decreases the depth of the field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dslr-camera-full-rig.jpg"                      alt="dslr camera"                ></p><h4 id="5-Depth-of-Field"><a href="#5-Depth-of-Field" class="headerlink" title="5. Depth of Field"></a>5. Depth of Field</h4><p>The lens has certain limitation to capture and focus the subject closely. The camera’s aperture can be adjusted to control the depth of your field.</p><p>What is an aperture? It is the opening of the lens. The smaller the opening of the lens is, the better is the depth of field for your macro video.</p><p>But, you must remember that when the opening of the lens is small, the light required is more. There must be an equal balance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/depth-of-field.JPG"                      alt="depth of field"                ></p><h4 id="6-Composition"><a href="#6-Composition" class="headerlink" title="6. Composition"></a>6. Composition</h4><p>When you have low lights, ensuring a correct perspective on the subject with maximum focus area is quite difficult. You must have the right composition for your macro video.</p><p>For instance, in order to keep a snail always in focus, you may choose to shoot it while it crawls perpendicular to the camera. If you shoot while it crawls towards you, only a part of the snail remains in focus at a certain point of time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/composition.JPG"                      alt="composition"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Once you can master the above tips for making the macro video, you can easily shoot small objects like a pro. A videographer’s experience and creativity can be matched even by you if you can easily grasp the techniques, practice it, and implement creatively while making your macro videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-speeding-up-your-periscope-streams-effortlessly/"><u>[New] Speeding Up Your Periscope Streams Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-metaverse-madness-top-tips-for-crafting-hitsome-memes/"><u>In 2024, Metaverse Madness  Top Tips for Crafting Hitsome Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-handp-a-comprehensive-strategy-for-fb-health-marketing/"><u>[Updated] Mastering H&P  A Comprehensive Strategy for FB Health Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-seamless-creation-accessing-elite-afx-templates-for-free/"><u>[Updated] Seamless Creation  Accessing Elite AFX Templates for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/reddits-hidden-gems-6-tactics-that-transform-beginners-into-titans-for-2024/"><u>Reddit's Hidden Gems  6 Tactics That Transform Beginners Into Titans for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-premium-cloud-storage-services-a-guides-choice/"><u>[New] Premium Cloud Storage Services  A Guide's Choice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-stop-automatically-added-podcast-episodes-via-spotifys-suggestions/"><u>In 2024, Stop Automatically Added Podcast Episodes via Spotify's Suggestions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-precision-in-speech-synthesis-converting-text-formats-to-srt/"><u>[New] Precision in Speech Synthesis  Converting Text Formats to SRT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/the-art-of-image-enhancement-pivotal-pixlr-insights-for-2024/"><u>The Art of Image Enhancement  Pivotal Pixlr Insights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-factory-reset-iphone-se-2022-and-ipad-without-apple-id-stellar-by-stellar-data-recovery-ios-iphone-data-recovery/"><u>How to Factory Reset iPhone SE (2022) and iPad Without Apple ID | Stellar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-simplifying-the-process-of-deleting-youtube-files/"><u>[New] Simplifying the Process of Deleting YouTube Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlocking-viral-videos-2-powerful-ways-to-master-tiktok-react-creation-in-filmora/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unlocking Viral Videos  2 Powerful Ways to Master TikTok React Creation in Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pro-tips-for-streaming-and-screening-netflix-on-mac/"><u>2024 Approved  Pro-Tips for Streaming & Screening Netflix on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/navigating-non-facebook-activities-exploration/"><u>Navigating Non-Facebook Activities Exploration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-on-oneplus-open-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/"><u>How to recover deleted photos on OnePlus Open</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-six-straightforward-mojang-homes-for-creative-builders/"><u>2024 Approved  Six Straightforward Mojang Homes for Creative Builders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-vimeo-simplified-platform-for-content-creators-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Vimeo Simplified  Platform for Content Creators for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

As the globe becomes connected, new trends and fads emerge regularly. One of these developments is Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), which has taken the world by storm in recent years. What began as a tiny community on sites such as YouTube has become a global sensation. Individuals of all ages (even celebrities!) are generating their own ASMR films on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and others.</p><p>But just what is ASMR? The experience differs from individual to individual, but the fundamental notion is the tingling feeling individuals get when exposed to specific noises such as whispering, tapping, and others. So <strong>why do people like ASMR</strong>? Read on to know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-1.png"                      alt="benefits of asmr"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR"><a href="#Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?"></a>Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?</h2><p>Some individuals experience ASMR in response to various sensory “triggers.” It may be listening to someone talk or tapping or seeing someone brush their hair or folding their clothing with care and precision. It could also be particular noises like tapping or whispering. In addition, one of the most common triggers in ordinary life is a light touch, such as caressing someone’s arm or tracing one’s fingers on the back.</p><p>Here are some fundamental reasons <strong>why people like ASMR</strong>:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-2.png"                      alt="why people like asmr"                ></p><ul><li><strong>ASMR helps one cope with Stress &amp; Anxiety:</strong> Studies fund that ASMR assists people in dealing with stress and anxiety. One <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2018/06/26/asmr-research-survey-affect-physiology/" >2018 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that ASMR reduced stress, while another in 2017 discovered that 11% of individuals viewed ASMR videos mainly to assist them in coping with anxiety. Similarly, 2015 research found that 70% of its participants utilized ASMR films to cope with stress. It’s not just anecdotal evidence—research reveals that individuals who watch ASMR regularly report feeling happier and less stressed than those who don’t!</li><li><strong>It helps some people solve sleeping issues:</strong> If this is the case, you are not alone. Many individuals use ASMR as a sleep aid by many individuals. According to a <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2017/11/09/asmr-research-survey-personality-empathy-triggers/" >2017 study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 41% of individuals utilized ASMR to help them fall asleep. Another <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that 82 percent of the subjects used ASMR to fall asleep because the videos are low-stress and calming. Because they generally center on relaxing sounds or sights, viewing ASMR videos might help you unwind after a busy day and prepare for the night.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?"></a>Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?</h2><p>Another pertinent query relating to the above section would be <strong>why ASMR is relaxing</strong>. Here is a detailed and factual answer.</p><p>ASMR is a sense of quiet, relaxation, and comfort from viewing particular videos that often show someone executing a delicate job, such as speaking or tapping on things. These films visibly improve people’s tranquillity and help them fall asleep quicker. They also establish a bond between the maker of the video and the viewer. You can trace this behavior back to ancient times when individuals would listen to others tell tales to feel comfortable and at peace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-3.jpg"                      alt="why is asmr relaxing"                ></p><p>Giulia Poerio’s Hubbub public engagement work has included her <a class="link"   href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28427/Bookshelf%5FNBK453230.pdf?sequence=1#page=123" >psychological research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). The research stated that relaxing, tingling sensations begin at the top of the head and spread down the neck, spine, and sometimes throughout the rest of the body in response to specific triggers. According to this study, ASMR is fascinating, whether experienced or not. The sheer number of YouTube videos and accompanying viewership data show that it is far from a niche experience. According to anecdotal evidence, you can use ASMR as a sleep aid and a technique for increasing wellness.</p><p>People have even employed ASMR to assist them in curing their discomfort. While it requires further research to support this assertion, they conducted a study to keep it. In <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015, an analysis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> indicated that 42 percent of individuals said ASMR helped them cope with chronic pain.</p><p>Scientists are still debating how ASMR can reduce chronic pain, although some relate it to the release of endorphins during an ASMR session. Endorphins are substances in the body that may make us happy and diminish our sense of pain. However, there is no authentication to support this idea.</p><p>Although they carried out a considerable study on ASMR and its impact on chronic pain, many individuals have found relief utilizing ASMR videos for their condition! If you suffer from chronic pain, try watching these ASMR videos for pleasure or to see if they help relieve your symptoms.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You"><a href="#Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?"></a>Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?</h2><p>The study of ASMR is in its infancy at the moment. However, both anecdotal evidence and preliminary studies suggest that autonomic sensory meridian response, or ASMR, will have some positive effects, including the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-4.jpg"                      alt="is asmr good"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Immediate Relief:</strong> When someone experiences the chills and tingles associated with ASMR, we describe it as a delightful and calming sensation that occurs relatively quickly after exposure to the stimulus.</li><li><strong>The elevated state of mind</strong>: Early research found that after exposure to ASMR, eighty percent of Trusted Source participants experienced an improvement in their mood. People with greater levels of depression had a quicker drop in their benefits.</li><li><strong>Pain alleviation:</strong> The same research According to Reliable Source, some individuals who suffer from chronic pain had relief that lasted for up to three hours after being exposed to the substance.</li><li><strong>Greater intensity of focus</strong>: When you’re so engrossed in something that you lose track of time and concentrate so intently on it, you’re said to be in a “flow state.” Researchers have discovered that ASMR and the sort of focused attention you get when you’re in the zone, also known as flow, have been commonalities.</li><li><strong>Better sleep:</strong> ASMR has been found in preliminary studies to have the potential to assist in inducing a state of relaxation. Also, improve brainwave activity, which is necessary for a good night’s rest.</li><li><strong>Other advantages:</strong> People who participate in ASMR activities note improvements in areas such as decreased anxiety, fewer migraines, lower blood pressure, and other health benefits. Although they are consistent with what they tell us, these assertions still need to be supported by more studies.</li></ul><p>The best part is that almost anybody can use it. If you think these advantages may benefit you, you can try them. You can find out <strong>if ASMR is good for you</strong> without spending money or a doctor’s prescription online.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQ-People-Also-Ask"><a href="#Part-4-FAQ-People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQ: People Also Ask"></a>Part 4: FAQ: People Also Ask</h2><h3 id="1-Does-ASMR-kill-brain-cells"><a href="#1-Does-ASMR-kill-brain-cells" class="headerlink" title="1.

Malware infections and potentially unwanted programs are an outcome of downloading from an unreliable source. There are many websites that specialize in dispersing malicious payloads by providing the downloader with something legitimate or bundling the required installer with some extra programs.</p><p>There are many threat initiators who look for the terms that are gaining popularity in the search results and seek out the terminated software downloads. Thereafter, they try to attract searchers to the website. These people use SEO techniques for ranking higher in the search engines. As a matter of fact, they might also spend a few dollars to show up in the search engine’s sponsored section. These sites hide their malware in the malvertising as downloads.</p><p>The threat actors just make sure that the searchers believe that they have found what they are looking for. If they are convinced, they are going to download and install the infected driver all by themselves. The threat actor just uploads the malware under a file name that will be convincing enough for attracting visitors to the website.</p><p>Section1. <a href="#s1">How to Assess a Website?</a></p><p>Section2. <a href="#s2">Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac</a></p><p>Section3. <a href="#s3">Top Websites to Download VLC Player for Mac for Free</a></p><p>Section4. <a href="#s4">How to Download and Install VLC Player on Mac?

This shows that the site has got a security certificate. However, this isn’t a guarantee that the website is safe for downloading the VLC player software.</p><p>SSL certificates come at a cheap price and a cybercriminal knows where they can get them almost for free. So, click on the green padlock to find out who has issued the certificate. You can also check the other sites that have received their SSL certificate from this particular authority.</p><h3 id="•-Use-a-Browser-Extension-or-a-Trusted-Anti-Virus-Software"><a href="#•-Use-a-Browser-Extension-or-a-Trusted-Anti-Virus-Software" class="headerlink" title="• Use a Browser Extension or a Trusted Anti-Virus Software"></a>• Use a Browser Extension or a Trusted Anti-Virus Software</h3><p>There are many free applications and browser extensions that will warn you about shady sites.

Albeit, some of these sites are reputable, they might fall behind when it comes to adding new users. Cybercriminals can dump a new domain just like that when it gets too many bad reviews and then purchase a new site from where they can run their scheme. So, when you are reading reviews, make sure that you are choosing sites that have been around for some time.</p><p>In case a site doesn’t have reviews, it means it has only started operating and it might be up to no good.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Tips-to-Filter-Malware-from-the-VLC-Download-Files-for-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Tips-to-Filter-Malware-from-the-VLC-Download-Files-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac"></a>Section 2.Tips to Filter Malware from the VLC Download Files for Mac</h2><p>There are a few methods that you can use to weed out the malware from the downloaded files.</p><h3 id="•-Check-The-Digital-Signature-Of-The-File"><a href="#•-Check-The-Digital-Signature-Of-The-File" class="headerlink" title="• Check The Digital Signature Of The File"></a>• Check The Digital Signature Of The File</h3><p>The digital signature of a file can be verified after you have downloaded it.

It helps in making the audial join smooth and avoids rough ends or disturbance in the output. Most commonly, fade effects are considered by professionals. In case you are using Premiere Pro and thinking of using the crossfade audio transition, you will have three options, such as –</p><p>● Constant power</p><p>● Constant gain</p><p>● Exponential fade</p><p>All these three options are leading to different effects. Now, it depends on the track and its nature and how it does it work on the video and audience. You should choose one option carefully. In case you want to add a quick effect of fade out and in, you should consider constant gain. The use of constant power will allow you to get a transition between both tracks without any gap or space lack. For slow fade out and in effects, you can go with the option of exponential fade. All these options will help you work out properly and make things much easier.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration"></a>Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/fade-out-music-pr-4.png"                      alt="Fade out by changing music duration "                ></p><p>Every time you may not feel the requirements of fade out and in settings of easy musical transition.

Next, click on the drop-down menu. Black bars will make your photos look bad, so you can crop them to ensure they coincide with the selected aspect ratio of 9:16. You can still zoom the image at this point as well. Before exiting the editing tab, add transitions and animations to your photos without forgetting the slide timers.</p><p>Select the “Fit” option once done. Return to the media panel to include more photos and media in the timeline. You can drag-drop the required files from the folder to the location where you want. The remaining part is simple- repeat the process and arrange files in your desired order. Adjust the duration of each image or media for a better outcome.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-n-drop-timeline.jpg"                      alt="filmora timeline"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Avoiding-cuts-in-slides-through-transitions-3"><a href="#Step3-Avoiding-cuts-in-slides-through-transitions-3" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Avoiding cuts in slides through transitions"></a>Step3 Avoiding cuts in slides through transitions</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-slideshow-transitions.jpg"                      alt="add transitions filmora"                ></p><p>Hard cuts distort the presentation, but you can evade them by using transitions. Filmora has many transitions that you can include in your presentation. Drag and drop them in the timeline. Also, avoid applying the same transition to all slides because this will look repetitive. Instead, make videos from photos with the song without the cut, including cuts in the slides for them to look great. Different transitions to different drops work best—Right-click on every slide to make necessary changes.</p><h5 id="Step4-Application-of-filters-overlays-to-improve-color-3"><a href="#Step4-Application-of-filters-overlays-to-improve-color-3" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Application of filters&#x2F;overlays to improve color"></a>Step4 Application of filters&#x2F;overlays to improve color</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-filters-options.jpg"                      alt="apply filters filmora"                ></p><p>The transitions tab is near the effects tab, with many visual effects that you can apply to your slides to make them catchier. You can filter the effects into categories and sub-categories like Light Leaks and Lomography. Apply an image filter by positioning it over the footage.</p><h5 id="Step5-Include-motion-graphics-3"><a href="#Step5-Include-motion-graphics-3" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Include motion graphics"></a>Step5 Include motion graphics</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-love-elements.jpg"                      alt="add motion graphics Filmora"                ></p><p>Although this part is not a must, it would be better to add moving images to your slides, making the video lively.

All the recordings that you will create will be available in the media section. There are also useful features that you can find helpful to include in the slides to make the audio systematic. For example, suddenly, a microphone will appear to enable you to record the audio played in the background of the recorded video.</p><h5 id="Step7-Export-slides-to-Filmora-3"><a href="#Step7-Export-slides-to-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Export slides to Filmora"></a>Step7 Export slides to Filmora</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/go-to-export-panel.jpg"                      alt="export video filmora"                ></p><p>Finally, you will have to export all the slides that you have created to Filmora.
