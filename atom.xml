Starting from opening titles and ending credits to transition slides and text snippets, texts and titles always enhance video content. It is quite obvious that animated texts draw more attention than showing static text effects. If you are new to video editing and text animation, you should be aware of the common types of text animation.</p><p>You should use these common text animations in your videos because the viewers are already comfortable watching them. Apart from using them directly, you should use them to create some interesting and stunning text animations so that the video looks different from others. We have listed down the common as well as interesting text animation examples for you.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Parallax scrolling</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Fade in and fade out</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Sliding text animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Text breaks away animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Typing text animation</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Morphing Text Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Combined Slide Out Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">The Stomp Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">The Curtain Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Animated Text Outline Effect</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-6">Animated Text Fill Effect</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-7">Neon Light Animation</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-8">In and Out of Focus Text Effect</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Make a Text Animation Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Types-of-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Types-of-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation"></a>Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation</h2><p>Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.</p><h3 id="1-Parallax-scrolling"><a href="#1-Parallax-scrolling" class="headerlink" title="1. Parallax scrolling"></a>1. Parallax scrolling</h3><p>Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.</p><h3 id="2-Fade-in-and-fade-out"><a href="#2-Fade-in-and-fade-out" class="headerlink" title="2. Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.</p><h3 id="4-Text-breaks-away-animation"><a href="#4-Text-breaks-away-animation" class="headerlink" title="4. Text breaks away animation"></a>4. Text breaks away animation</h3><p>There are different variations of text breaks away animation but it is one of the most visually appealing text animations. That text appears on the video and it shatters and disappears. Sometimes, the text turns into dust after shattering like a glass. This text effect cum animation is highly impactful in getting the attention of the viewers immediately.</p><h3 id="5-Typing-text-animation"><a href="#5-Typing-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="5. Typing text animation"></a>5. Typing text animation</h3><p>Referred to as typewriter text animation as well, the characters in a word or sentence appear on the screen one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time. There is always a cursor blinking at the end of the character and it shifts with the appearance of the words and sentences. Instead of showing words or sentences all at once, showing text as if someone is typing it on the screen is more visually pleasing.</p><h3 id="6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text"><a href="#6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text" class="headerlink" title="6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text"></a>6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</h3><p>Last but not least, the vertical scrolling text effect is extremely common for opening and closing credits in movies. This is even used in modern short videos to show credits as well as information as per requirements. Along with vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling text is quite common these days to show a few lines of text instead of showing them together in a paragraph.</p><h2 id="Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples"><a href="#Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples"></a>Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</h2><p>You should always keep the basic and the common types of text animations in mind and come up with interesting and creative text animations. We are listing down some popular text animation examples that you can use on your video.</p><h3 id="1-Morphing-Text-Animation"><a href="#1-Morphing-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="1. Morphing Text Animation"></a>1. Morphing Text Animation</h3><p>When there are multiple words to display one by one, instead of fade in and fade out effect, you can opt for morphing text animation. In this animation, the words seem to get morphed into one another. So, the first word will morph into the second word for the second word to appear on the screen and the sequence continues. The animation can be done fast to showcase multiple words in a short time period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/morphing-text-animation.jpg"                      alt="morphing text animation"                ></p><h3 id="2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation"><a href="#2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation" class="headerlink" title="2. Combined Slide Out Animation"></a>2. Combined Slide Out Animation</h3><p>Generally, in a slide out text animation, the text comes out of a border and the animation type remains the same throughout. However, in the modified slide out animation, the text comes out of the border but it can come out of the top, the side, as well as both sides of the border. The border can also animate to move from the side to the top as well as be placed obliquely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/combined-slide-out-animation.jpg"                      alt="combined slide out animation"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-Stomp-Animation"><a href="#3-The-Stomp-Animation" class="headerlink" title="3. The Stomp Animation"></a>3. The Stomp Animation</h3><p>The stomp effect is quite eye-catching due to its dynamic nature. In this animation, the words come out from another word till the entire sentence is displayed. For example, you have a sentence of four words to display. So, you should show the first word and the second word will come out of the first word and the sequence will continue. If you have two words, you can show them coming out of one another from the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-stomp-animation.jpg"                      alt="the stomp animation"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Curtain-Animation"><a href="#4-The-Curtain-Animation" class="headerlink" title="4. The Curtain Animation"></a>4. The Curtain Animation</h3><p>In this animation, the moving boxes will slide in and slide out and in the process, they will reveal the text hidden behind them. It looks similar to parting the curtain and getting a view. Thereafter, the boxes will slide back in and cover up the text. The sequence will continue to reveal new texts as required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-curtain-animation.jpg"                      alt="the curtain animation"                ></p><h3 id="5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect"><a href="#5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Animated Text Outline Effect"></a>5. Animated Text Outline Effect</h3><p>This is one of the stunning After Effects text animation examples whereby the outline of the text is made to animate with different colors so that the text becomes eye-catching. The text fill color should stay the same as the background so that only the outline is visible and the outline will be moving around one another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-outline-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated outline effect"                ></p><h3 id="6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect"><a href="#6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect" class="headerlink" title="6. Animated Text Fill Effect"></a>6. Animated Text Fill Effect</h3><p>This is one of the most popular GSAP text animation examples whereby you display a sentence with bold style and a color should be moving across the characters in the text. The animated text fill will stay within the characters and should not spill out in the background. The background should be dark for better focus and attention grabbing. Sometimes, people make the color roll from left to right or the text can have a gradient color with the color waving up and down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-text-fill-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated text fill effect"                ></p><h3 id="7-Neon-Light-Animation"><a href="#7-Neon-Light-Animation" class="headerlink" title="7. Neon Light Animation"></a>7. Neon Light Animation</h3><p>There are different variations of neon light animation that cool super cool. You can go for the simple neon light animation where the text says still and the neon lights fade in and out. You can change the color of the lights if you plan to keep the text for some time. If you are using a large text, you can go for the modified neon light animation where you can shine in and out for individual characters and the lights could be flickering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/neon-light-animation.jpg"                      alt="neon light animation"                ></p><h3 id="8-In-and-Out-of-Focus-Text-Effect"><a href="#8-In-and-Out-of-Focus-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="8. In and Out of Focus Text Effect"></a>8. In and Out of Focus Text Effect</h3><p>Instead of bringing the entire sentence into focus, you can use a square box to run over the sentence and bring the focus on the words depending on the position of the square box. The animation is highly effective in getting the viewers to read the sentence and get the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/in-and-out-focus-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="in and out focus text effect"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Common Types of Text Animation"></a>Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation</h2><p>Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.</p><h3 id="1-Parallax-scrolling-1"><a href="#1-Parallax-scrolling-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Parallax scrolling"></a>1. Parallax scrolling</h3><p>Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.</p><h3 id="2-Fade-in-and-fade-out-1"><a href="#2-Fade-in-and-fade-out-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation-1"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.</p><h3 id="4-Text-breaks-away-animation-1"><a href="#4-Text-breaks-away-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Text breaks away animation"></a>4. Text breaks away animation</h3><p>There are different variations of text breaks away animation but it is one of the most visually appealing text animations. That text appears on the video and it shatters and disappears. Sometimes, the text turns into dust after shattering like a glass. This text effect cum animation is highly impactful in getting the attention of the viewers immediately.</p><h3 id="5-Typing-text-animation-1"><a href="#5-Typing-text-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Typing text animation"></a>5. Typing text animation</h3><p>Referred to as typewriter text animation as well, the characters in a word or sentence appear on the screen one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time. There is always a cursor blinking at the end of the character and it shifts with the appearance of the words and sentences. Instead of showing words or sentences all at once, showing text as if someone is typing it on the screen is more visually pleasing.</p><h3 id="6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text-1"><a href="#6-Horizontal-and-vertical-scrolling-text-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text"></a>6. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text</h3><p>Last but not least, the vertical scrolling text effect is extremely common for opening and closing credits in movies. This is even used in modern short videos to show credits as well as information as per requirements. Along with vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling text is quite common these days to show a few lines of text instead of showing them together in a paragraph.</p><h2 id="Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-2-8-Interesting-Text-Animation-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples"></a>Part 2. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples</h2><p>You should always keep the basic and the common types of text animations in mind and come up with interesting and creative text animations. We are listing down some popular text animation examples that you can use on your video.</p><h3 id="1-Morphing-Text-Animation-1"><a href="#1-Morphing-Text-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Morphing Text Animation"></a>1. Morphing Text Animation</h3><p>When there are multiple words to display one by one, instead of fade in and fade out effect, you can opt for morphing text animation. In this animation, the words seem to get morphed into one another. So, the first word will morph into the second word for the second word to appear on the screen and the sequence continues. The animation can be done fast to showcase multiple words in a short time period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/morphing-text-animation.jpg"                      alt="morphing text animation"                ></p><h3 id="2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation-1"><a href="#2-Combined-Slide-Out-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Combined Slide Out Animation"></a>2. Combined Slide Out Animation</h3><p>Generally, in a slide out text animation, the text comes out of a border and the animation type remains the same throughout. However, in the modified slide out animation, the text comes out of the border but it can come out of the top, the side, as well as both sides of the border. The border can also animate to move from the side to the top as well as be placed obliquely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/combined-slide-out-animation.jpg"                      alt="combined slide out animation"                ></p><h3 id="3-The-Stomp-Animation-1"><a href="#3-The-Stomp-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="3. The Stomp Animation"></a>3. The Stomp Animation</h3><p>The stomp effect is quite eye-catching due to its dynamic nature. In this animation, the words come out from another word till the entire sentence is displayed. For example, you have a sentence of four words to display. So, you should show the first word and the second word will come out of the first word and the sequence will continue. If you have two words, you can show them coming out of one another from the middle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-stomp-animation.jpg"                      alt="the stomp animation"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Curtain-Animation-1"><a href="#4-The-Curtain-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="4. The Curtain Animation"></a>4. The Curtain Animation</h3><p>In this animation, the moving boxes will slide in and slide out and in the process, they will reveal the text hidden behind them. It looks similar to parting the curtain and getting a view. Thereafter, the boxes will slide back in and cover up the text. The sequence will continue to reveal new texts as required.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-curtain-animation.jpg"                      alt="the curtain animation"                ></p><h3 id="5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect-1"><a href="#5-Animated-Text-Outline-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Animated Text Outline Effect"></a>5. Animated Text Outline Effect</h3><p>This is one of the stunning After Effects text animation examples whereby the outline of the text is made to animate with different colors so that the text becomes eye-catching. The text fill color should stay the same as the background so that only the outline is visible and the outline will be moving around one another.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-outline-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated outline effect"                ></p><h3 id="6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect-1"><a href="#6-Animated-Text-Fill-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Animated Text Fill Effect"></a>6. Animated Text Fill Effect</h3><p>This is one of the most popular GSAP text animation examples whereby you display a sentence with bold style and a color should be moving across the characters in the text. The animated text fill will stay within the characters and should not spill out in the background. The background should be dark for better focus and attention grabbing. Sometimes, people make the color roll from left to right or the text can have a gradient color with the color waving up and down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animated-text-fill-effect.jpg"                      alt="animated text fill effect"                ></p><h3 id="7-Neon-Light-Animation-1"><a href="#7-Neon-Light-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Neon Light Animation"></a>7. Neon Light Animation</h3><p>There are different variations of neon light animation that cool super cool. You can go for the simple neon light animation where the text says still and the neon lights fade in and out. You can change the color of the lights if you plan to keep the text for some time. If you are using a large text, you can go for the modified neon light animation where you can shine in and out for individual characters and the lights could be flickering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/neon-light-animation.jpg"                      alt="neon light animation"                ></p><h3 id="8-In-and-Out-of-Focus-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#8-In-and-Out-of-Focus-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="8. In and Out of Focus Text Effect"></a>8. In and Out of Focus Text Effect</h3><p>Instead of bringing the entire sentence into focus, you can use a square box to run over the sentence and bring the focus on the words depending on the position of the square box. The animation is highly effective in getting the viewers to read the sentence and get the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/in-and-out-focus-text-effect.jpg"                      alt="in and out focus text effect"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Text-Animation-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Most of the headsets have the ability to track the user’s head movements so that the wherever the user looks, the character in the virtual reality also looks. If done in the right manner, the headsets give an impression of the user being actually inside the game or the movie, hence the name “virtual reality”.</p><h2 id="How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work"><a href="#How-does-Virtual-Reality-headsets-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Virtual Reality headsets work"></a>How does Virtual Reality headsets work</h2><p> The principle goal of the virtual reality headsets is to create life-size, 3D virtual environments with no boundaries like those associated with computer or television screens. In case of the Rift or HTC’s Vive, video is sent from the computer or the console to the headset through a HDMI cable, while for the Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, the videos are already on the smartphone mounted on the headsets.</p><p> The VR headsets may use a single feed or two feeds sent directly to either one or two LCD displays, one for each eye. There are also a set of lenses placed between the user’s eyes and the pixels and this is the reason why the devices are sometimes referred to as goggles. In some cases, the lenses can be adjusted to match the distance between the eyes and this distance will also vary from one user to another.</p><p> The lenses will focus and reshape the images for each eye before creating a stereoscopic 3D image by positioning the 2D images to portray how each of the two eyes see the world. One way in which the virtual reality headsets increases immersion is by increasing the field of view or simply how wide a picture appears. A 360 degrees display may not be convenient and most of the high end VR headsets usually use 100 or 110 degree field of views, which is usually sufficient enough to give the effects.</p><p> And for the final images to be totally convincing, the VR headsets use minimum frame rates of 60fps to do away with shuttering or make the users feel sick.</p><h2 id="Top-VR-headsets-overview"><a href="#Top-VR-headsets-overview" class="headerlink" title="Top VR headsets overview"></a>Top VR headsets overview</h2><p> The race by tech giants to get their share of the virtual reality market is on and company after company is burning the midnight oil to produce the next best headset.</p><p> Below is a list of the various VR headsets currently available to purchase:</p><h3 id="HTC-Vive"><a href="#HTC-Vive" class="headerlink" title="HTC Vive"></a>HTC Vive</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/htc-vive.png"                      alt="ghtc-vive-vr"                ></p><p> HTC Vive VR headset is made in collaboration with Valve and it plugs directly into PCs and uses Valve’s humongous gaming ecosystem. The headset has over 70 sensors to allow for 360 degrees head tracking and it also boasts of a 90Hz refresh rate responsible for keeping down the latency, which in turn saves the users from suffering motions sickness. This headset is currently available for purchase from $799.</p><h3 id="Samsung-Gear-VR"><a href="#Samsung-Gear-VR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Gear VR"></a>Samsung Gear VR</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gear-vr.png"                      alt="gear-vr"                ></p><p> The Samsung Gear VR is essentially Oculus Rift lite, owing to the fact that the two companies worked on the technology together. The Gear VR uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone for the display and as the processor. The phone slots in front of the lenses and into a Micro USB slot, and uses the super AMOLED display as the screen. With the Gear, all you have to do is to slot in the phone, put on the headset and start enjoying the virtual reality experience.</p><h3 id="Oculus-Rift"><a href="#Oculus-Rift" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Rift"></a>Oculus Rift</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oculus-rift.jpg"                      alt="oculus-rift"                ></p><p> Oculus Rift headset was responsible for the current hysteria in virtual reality. The Rift plugs into the computer’s USB and DVI ports and tracks the movements of the head to provide 3D displays on its stereo screens. The consumer edition of the Rift comes with a 2160 x 1200 resolution as well as a refresh rate of 90Hz. The Rift matches HTC Vive in terms of the refresh rate, but lags behind Sony’s PlayStation VR, though it is a pretty advanced VR headset in terms of the technology used.</p><h3 id="Sony-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Sony-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Sony PlayStation VR"></a>Sony PlayStation VR</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-playstation-vr.jpg"                      alt="sony-playstation-vr"                ></p><p> Sony has finally announced the launch date for the PlayStation VR headset and this is expected to be 13th October 2016. A new version though, was announced way back in 2015 and it featured a 5-inch LCD display of the original prototype. For the version to be released, it is expected to have a 5.7 inch OLED to allow for low persistence which will in turn translate to less motion blur. The refresh rate for Sony’s PlayStation VR has been ramped up to 120Hz, making it possible to have 120fps gaming.</p><h3 id="Google-Cardboard"><a href="#Google-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="Google Cardboard"></a>Google Cardboard</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-cardboard-vr.jpg"                      alt="google-cardboard-vr"                ></p><p> Not to be left behind, Google also has a cardboard virtual reality headset. With this headset, it sounds like popping your smartphone in a cardboard container and putting it over your head for a virtual reality experience. Sounds like a joke, but you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that it works like charm and it is also low cost. If anything, the smartphone you have already has all the gyroscopic sensors as well as the positioning devices needed to track your head movements.</p><p> Since the Cardboard has grown so much in terms of popularity, Google has planned to release a better version known as Daydream. This will be a device like the Gear VR, but it has been designed to work with android phones which are currently being revamped to over better VR experiences. It is still not know when the new device will be available, but the Cardboard is retailing at $16.99 at Amazon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-redefining-high-definition-with-samsungs-ubd-k850u-update/"><u>[New] Redefining High Definition with Samsung's UBD K850U Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quick-humor-crafting-the-meme-text-genrator-way/"><u>2024 Approved  Quick Humor Crafting  The Meme Text Gen'rator Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-perfecting-photos-with-facetune-your-ultimate-2024-guide/"><u>[New] Perfecting Photos with Facetune  Your Ultimate 2024 Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-photo-perfection-erasing-with-ease-in-photoshop/"><u>[New] Photo Perfection  Erasing with Ease in Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/photo-perfection-best-practices-for-integrating-frames-online-for-2024/"><u>Photo Perfection  Best Practices for Integrating Frames Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionizing-healthcare-cyber-therapies/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionizing Healthcare  Cyber-Therapies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-photo-and-video-edits-made-easy-select-the-best-8-apps-for-android-ios/"><u>In 2024, Photo & Video Edits Made Easy  Select the Best 8 Apps for Android, iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-proficient-approaches-for-tiktok-bios-with-linked-content/"><u>[Updated] Proficient Approaches for TikTok Bios with Linked Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-remove-default-podcasts-from-your-spotify-feed/"><u>2024 Approved  Remove Default Podcasts From Your Spotify Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fixing-foneazy-mockgo-not-working-on-honor-90-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Fixing Foneazy MockGo Not Working On Honor 90 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-election-excursions-best-gamified-democracy-sites/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Election Excursions  Best Gamified Democracy Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/insiders-selection-prime-vr-device-picks-for-2024/"><u>Insider's Selection  Prime VR Device Picks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-a-full-assessment-of-the-android-based-photo-editor-lightroom/"><u>[Updated] A Full Assessment of the Android-Based Photo Editor, Lightroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-video-editor-for-mac-mkvtoolnix-review-and-tutorial-2023/"><u>In 2024, Easy Video Editor for Mac MKVtoolnix Review and Tutorial 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/r-crafters-fusing-visual-and-acoustic-art-for-2024/"><u>Master Crafters Fusing Visual & Acoustic Art for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-music-files-from-xiaomi-redmi-k70-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>How To  Restore Missing Music Files from Xiaomi Redmi K70</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-retrieving-tweets-as-gifs/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering the Art of Retrieving Tweets as GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/from-novice-to-expert-a-telegram-web-blueprint-for-2024/"><u>From Novice to Expert  A Telegram Web Blueprint for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-the-insiders-look-at-editing-in-youtube-studio/"><u>2024 Approved  The Insider's Look at Editing in YouTube Studio</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

What is a WebP file?"></a>1. What is a WebP file?</h4><p>WebP is a new type of image format developed by Google that offers both lossy and lossless compression ratio while maintaining the quality of the photo at the same time. Such pictures occupy less space on the web servers, and load comparatively faster when opened in a web browser, thus saving the Internet bandwidth.</p><h4 id="2-Why-you-should-use-WebP-format"><a href="#2-Why-you-should-use-WebP-format" class="headerlink" title="2. Why you should use WebP format?"></a>2. Why you should use WebP format?</h4><p>Since WebP files are smaller in size but still offer high picture quality, you should use the format if you are a site owner and want to utilize the web space optimally. The format also saves users’ Internet bandwidth by loading comparatively sooner on the Internet browser while surfing the web.</p><h4 id="3-Why-can’t-I-open-WebP-format-on-Windows-10-Photos"><a href="#3-Why-can’t-I-open-WebP-format-on-Windows-10-Photos" class="headerlink" title="3.

Why can’t I open WebP format on Windows 10 Photos?</h4><p>WebP files are primarily prepared for web interface, and the default association of the *.webp extension is with your web browser. Since the Photos app in Windows 10 only supports image (and sometime video) files, you need an efficient <strong>WebP to JPG</strong> converter to first convert the pictures to JPG format, and then open them in the Photos app that Windows 10 has.</p><h4 id="4-How-to-Open-WebP-on-Windows-10-and-Mac-s"><a href="#4-How-to-Open-WebP-on-Windows-10-and-Mac-s" class="headerlink" title="4. How to Open WebP on Windows 10 and Mac?s"></a>4. How to Open WebP on Windows 10 and Mac?s</h4><p>Because WebP files are intended to be used on the web, you can use your default Internet browser (Microsoft Edge for Windows and Safari for Mac) to view the images. However, if you want to open the photos like any other picture, you need to <strong>convert WebP to JPG</strong> before you can do so.</p><p>5. <strong>How to convert photos to PDF?</strong></p><p><a

It allows users to record everything in while keeping their hands free and the best part is that most of these are designed with outstanding qualities like water resistant, shockproof, freeze resistant and many more. Some of these can also be controlled via voice commands or remote applications hence they serve like best tool for athletes, professionals and beginner photographers. The wearable cameras can be clipped to almost all kind of surfaces; you can attach them to helmet, hat, harness, belt, T-shirt and even on your pets.</p><h2 id="What-to-look-for-while-buying-a-wearable-action-camera"><a href="#What-to-look-for-while-buying-a-wearable-action-camera" class="headerlink" title="What to look for while buying a wearable action camera"></a>What to look for while buying a wearable action camera</h2><p>Now you must be well aware of the fact that a wearable camera can help you enjoy your lifestyle in unique way and it can record everything for you on the go. But if you are new to camera world and are confused while making decision after watching so many competitive brands then it is good to make a list about what you must look for while buying an action camera. Below are few important features that your camera must have:</p><ol><li><strong>Photo and Video Quality:</strong> First of all you must compare the photo as well as video quality of your camera so that it can create high resolution end results and your videos can be YouTube ready right after recording.</li><li><strong>Camera weight, size and shape:</strong> Bullet shaped cameras are considered to be best if you want something to mount on your helmet whereas for chest mounting needs you must go ahead with box shaped cameras. A heavy camera unit will not fulfil your recording needs while biking or surfing so prefer to buy lightweight one with a small size.</li><li><strong>Streaming and Connectivity:</strong> It must be equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity options so that you can easily share, stream and view your collections on other devices. It also helps to operate your camera from remote locations via phone. Prefer to buy a camera that allows direct synchronization with websites for live streaming.</li><li><strong>Storage Capacity:</strong> Of course it must be higher, usually wearable action cameras can have microSD card capacity somewhere between 4GB to 120GB so you can make decision accordingly. Prefer to carry additional cards on your long tours.</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-sports?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h2 id="Top-10-Best-Wearable-Action-Cameras-2017"><a href="#Top-10-Best-Wearable-Action-Cameras-2017" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Best Wearable Action Cameras 2017"></a>Top 10 Best Wearable Action Cameras 2017</h2><p>Most of adventure lovers prefer to carry a camera with them so that everything can be recorded during outdoor activities.

You need not to apply any additional protective arrangement to your Sony action camera yet it will serve with splash resistant capabilities. Go Pro hero4 Black is a tiny device with dimensions 41x59x30mm when here is no housing attached.</li><li><strong>Display (Screen):</strong><br> GoPro Hero4 Black comes with 2 inch touch screen type display that assists users in easy preview. One can playback his shots, trim recorded footage and also adjust basic settings from this display. SONY FDR X1000V possesses built in LCD display that provides 2.8 times better results as compared to its predecessors.</li><li><strong>Interface:</strong><br> The Sony device includes so many control options with its menus and extended sub menus. They can help you to navigate through various tasks such as switching to Wi-Fi connectivity. You will find 12 buttons on its hardware that can be used for various settings. On the other side the GoPro interface is rated as simpler and intuitive with 11 buttons.<br><strong>Performance:</strong></li></ol><p> If we track the specifications of both these devices then definitely GoPro Hero4 wins with its feature rich design. GoPro can capture breath-taking stills with its 12MP resolution whereas Sony device is limited to 8.8MP capabilities. The Field of View offered by both devices is 120 degrees but in case of Sony photos can be captured at 170 degree focus. In both these cameras you can preview your captured photographs side by side.</p><p> When stills are captured in normal light conditions using GoPro device they result in sharper colour information with perfect adjustments of reds and greens. The GoPro colour settings can be enabled or disabled by user as per need. But in case of Sony FDR you will find more influence of blue in stills. This feature make it suitable action camera for snowboarders and surfers as they can capture the colour of sky or ocean with much better clarity. The low light details are finer in case of GoPro with sharp resolution.</p><p> Time-lapse video mode is supported by both cameras but Sony device limits its capabilities to 1080p resolution level whereas you can achieve 4K shooting with GoPro Hero4 Black. Sony also demands little efforts for generation of time lapse videos after footage generation but in case of GoPro you will get ready to upload file at the end. You will avail impressive results with both cameras even in adverse weather conditions and footage will not appear shaky. Audio track was observed to provide better results in case of GoPro where noise attenuation is much finer.</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong></p><p> Although Sony FDR is a waterproof device without housing but it can go under water only up to 32 feet whereas Hero4 is a dive special unit that can reach up to 131 feet. Sony is no doubt bulkier as compared to its competitor with its splash resistant body but at the same time features are approaching to serve best.</p><p><strong>Battery and Memory:</strong></p><p> Sony X1000 action camera provides outstanding battery life with its 1240 mAh module but on the other side GoPro comes with 1160mAh battery capability. FDR has rechargeable battery and it can serve up to 3 hours 17 minutes when user is working with 1080p resolution but prefer to keep Wi-Fi off. Hero4 can work tirelessly up to 1.54 hours with series of photos. Prefer to use MicroSDXC card for better storage results with Sony device whereas Hero4 Black works fine with Class 10 cards.</p><p><strong>Wi-Fi and Apps:</strong></p><p> Both action cameras are Wi-Fi enabled so you can have remote control on your footage but if we talk about GPS then this feature is missing in GoPro Hero4 Black. Although there are 12 buttons on Sony and 11 on GoPro body but Wi-Fi enabled applications assists in easy navigation.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p> Those who are in search of impressive image quality can go ahead with Sony FDRX1000V but for under water needs GoPro device is proven to be better. The footage sharpness is higher in GoPro with its higher frame rate settings and stills here appear much vibrant. You will definitely find so many advantages of GoPro that is why it is a leader in action camera market but at the same time Sony has its own strengths even with and offering that is $140 cheaper and still has longer battery life as well as GPS capability.</p><p> Selection for right device completely depends upon your requirements as both these units have excellence in unique features. It is advised to rate features as per your need and then pick your device from market to avail maximum benefits. On price point of view, definitely you should go for Sony FDR X1000V.</p><p><strong>Recommend best video editing software for action camera users</strong></p><p> If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Premium-Cameras-for-360°-Film-Enthusiasts"><a href="#Premium-Cameras-for-360°-Film-Enthusiasts" class="headerlink" title="Premium Cameras for 360° Film Enthusiasts"></a>Premium Cameras for 360° Film Enthusiasts</h2><h1 id="5-Best-360-degree-Action-Cameras-You-Should-Use"><a href="#5-Best-360-degree-Action-Cameras-You-Should-Use" class="headerlink" title="5 Best 360-degree Action Cameras You Should Use"></a>5 Best 360-degree Action Cameras You Should Use</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Liza-Brown"><a href="#Liza-Brown" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Maybe you want to record some beautiful scenery while travelling, or capture the perfect action shot from your sailboat. While professional cameras are often heavy and delicate, not to mention expensive, smaller action cameras combine affordability and durability. While that’s a good start, the newest offerings offer full, 360-degree images to capture every part of the experience.</p><p>While 360-degree video isn’t yet in widespread use, VR headsets are becoming more and more affordable. These are made for 360-degree video and photos, where users are allowed to turn and look whichever way interests them most, and explore the whole scene, not just the parts that you first thought were worth capturing.</p><p>Here are 5 great 360-degree action cameras, specially chosen for being compact, affordable, and high quality.</p><h2 id="1-Nikon-Keymission-360"><a href="#1-Nikon-Keymission-360" class="headerlink" title="1. Nikon Keymission 360"></a>1. Nikon Keymission 360</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-action-camera-nikon-keymission.jpg"                      alt="360 degree action camera - Nikon Key Mission 360"                ></p><p>This upcoming camera, made by a prominent camera company, is set to be a big player in the 360 action cam market. With an expected retail price of $499, it will be comparable to other cameras in the market. This two lens camera is meant to take everything you can throw at it, being waterproof to 100 feet, as well as dust, shock, and cold resistant. The camera will shoot in 4K UHD, with other details about still photo quality still to be released. While we won’t know for sure how well Samsung delivers on its promises until the camera is released, expectations are high. Expect this new entry to be a strong competitor in the market, and if you don’t need a 360-degree camera just yet, it may well be worth waiting for this one.</p><h2 id="2-Giroptic-360cam"><a href="#2-Giroptic-360cam" class="headerlink" title="2. Giroptic 360cam"></a>2. Giroptic 360cam</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affordable-360-camera-giroptic.jpg"                      alt="360 degree action camera - Giroptic"                ></p><p>This pear-shaped camera has three lenses, whose images are combined to form a composite. It isn’t quite as tough as Nikon’s is expected to be, but is waterproof to 30 ft and features an accelerometer and gyroscope to help keep video steady and level while shooting. With a video resolution of 1024x2048 and photo resolution of 2048x4096, this camera is built to take high quality video. At about $500, it is a similar price to the Nikon, and many other contenders in the category. This camera is controlled remotely using an app and allows live streaming. While it’s great for taking an action video, it also works well as a security camera, as it can be set to start recording upon detection of sound or motion.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full review for Giroptic &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-VSN-360"><a href="#3-VSN-360" class="headerlink" title="3. VSN 360"></a>3. VSN 360</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-action-camera-vsn.jpg"                      alt="360 degree action camera - VSN 360"                ></p><p>This camera counts in the 360-degree market because horizontally, it takes a full 360-degree image. However, its vertical view is limited to a 60-degree angle. This shortcoming is one of the reasons that many people prefer other cameras for their VR film making. Instead of using multiple lenses, the VSN 360 relies on a single camera and a conical mirror to capture its 360-degree view. Retailing for around $449, this camera is less expensive than some, but more expensive, and tougher, than the 360-cams designed for more mundane uses. Some people criticize its video quality, but then, it was an early entrant in a category that is growing rapidly. Like most others, it uses an app for most camera controls, as well as for its video conferencing capabilities, not the most action packed use, but an interesting one.</p><h2 id="4-Kodak-Pixpro-SP360"><a href="#4-Kodak-Pixpro-SP360" class="headerlink" title="4. Kodak Pixpro SP360"></a>4. Kodak Pixpro SP360</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-action-camera-kodak-pixpro-sp360.jpg"                      alt="360 degree action camera - Kodak Pixpro SP"                ></p><p>Offered by the well-known Kodak company, this camera uses a single, dome shaped lens to capture a 360-degree view of the world. At $449, this is slightly less expensive than other cameras. Like the Keymission, this camera is built like a tank, resistant to water, shocks, and dust. However, unlike the Keymission, it is not waterproof, so I wouldn’t take it swimming with you. It shoots stills with 8MP resolution, and 2880x2880 video. For many people, the quality of the images shot by the Kodak camera just doesn’t measure up to other 360-degree cameras. Still, as one of the toughest inexpensive models available, consider it if you tend to be hard on your gear.</p><h2 id="5-BublCam"><a href="#5-BublCam" class="headerlink" title="5. BublCam"></a>5. BublCam</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affordable-360-camera-bublcam.png"                      alt="360 degree action camera - Bublcam"                ></p><p>Retailing for $800, Bublcam is the most expensive camera in this line up, but makes up for it with its high-quality, spherical photos and videos. Bublcam uses 4 lenses to take 14 MP stills and 1080p video, and includes motion activated stabilization features to keep shaky camera work from ruining your videos. The camera is best controlled through the app, available for iOS or Android, but can also be run in a rudimentary fashion using the buttons on the device. As a nice feature, the BublCam has an SD card slot for extra storage.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Full review for Bublecam &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you’re looking for a 360-degree camera, or if you’re thinking about it now, consider these 5 in your search. Before you choose one, think about what you will use it for, as that has a huge impact on which camera best fits your needs. Do your research to find the camera that’s fit to capture your life moments and help you share them with everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-sizing-up-show-content-optimal-episode-count/"><u>[Updated] Sizing Up Show Content  Optimal Episode Count</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-prime-list-of-affordable-high-definition-cameras/"><u>In 2024, Prime List of Affordable High Definition Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-masterlist-of-top-17-apps-to-purge-photos-edges/"><u>2024 Approved  Masterlist of Top 17 Apps to Purge Photos' Edges</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-reel-motivation-a-curated-list-of-top-10-film-titles/"><u>[Updated] Reel Motivation  A Curated List of Top 10 Film Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-mirthful-methods-building-humor-in-a-click/"><u>[Updated] Mirthful Methods  Building Humor in a Click</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-snap-spectacularly-with-top-10-sticker-enhancing-phone-apps/"><u>In 2024, Snap Spectacularly with Top 10 Sticker-Enhancing Phone Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-color-grading-utilizing-luts-from-cg-central/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Color Grading  Utilizing LUTs From CG Central</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-no-money-more-matches-live-record-and-trim-soccer-games/"><u>[Updated] No Money, More Matches  Live, Record & Trim Soccer Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-metaverse-and-multimeva-a-comparative-study-of-features/"><u>[New] Metaverse and Multimeva  A Comparative Study of Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-photo-deformation-masterclass-essentials/"><u>[Updated] Photo Deformation Masterclass Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-channel-triumphs-with-trending-hashtags/"><u>[Updated] Channel Triumphs with Trending Hashtags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-an-unresponsive-realme-narzo-n55-screen-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide How to Fix an Unresponsive Realme Narzo N55 Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-mastering-whatsapps-call-conversation-strategy/"><u>[New] Mastering WhatsApp's Call Conversation Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/by-step-strategy-for-unearthing-secret-youtube-videos/"><u>Step-by-Step Strategy for Unearthing Secret YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-youtube-mastery-perfecting-edits-on-published-videos/"><u>[Updated] YouTube Mastery  Perfecting Edits on Published Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-podcast-vs-youtube-the-ideal-medium-explored/"><u>[Updated] Podcast vs YouTube  The Ideal Medium Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-capture-and-save-windows-screen-shots-made-simple-for-2024/"><u>[New] Capture and Save  Windows Screen Shots Made Simple for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-quick-guide-downloading-and-prepping-vrecord/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Quick Guide  Downloading & Prepping VRecord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-crafting-content-that-captivates-a-guide-to-facebook-reels/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Crafting Content that Captivates  A Guide to Facebook Reels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-empower-yourself-learning-the-ins-and-outs-of-io-screen-recorder/"><u>[New] In 2024, Empower Yourself  Learning the Ins and Outs of IO Screen Recorder</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Because VR is still relatively new it may not even be something that you have experienced yet. In this article we will explain what VR technology is and the types of applications it can have for the future.</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Android Phones in Watching VR or 360 Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >A Brief History of Virtual Reality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/virtual-reality-technology-current-state-and-future-challenges.html" >Virtual Reality Technology: Current State and Future Challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</p><h2 id="What-is-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#What-is-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="What is Virtual Reality?"></a>What is Virtual Reality?</h2><p> Virtual Reality can be considered an extremely immersive experience that you can enjoy safely and simulate something real. By using a <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/what-is-vr-headset.html" >Virtual Reality headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or applicable application, you can enter into special simulations. These simulations are designed to be extremely immersive experiences which the user can interact with and explore. The viewer controls the environment and has the power to look around at any scene as well as potentially interact with the objects in the scene.</p><p> Virtual Reality usually take place in computer-generated simulations in which an entire 3-D environment is rendered in the closest thing to a simulation. A person can then use a variety of electronic equipment to interact with the scene and control the environment.</p><p> Overall, virtual reality means creating a simulation of a real world experience that a person can enter and leave at any time using technology. As VR continues to develop, we will only see these simulations getting more in-depth and real. The technology also continues to miniaturize and grow cheaper, bringing VR to a position where almost anyone could have the chance to try it.</p><h2 id="How-does-VR-work"><a href="#How-does-VR-work" class="headerlink" title="How does VR work?"></a>How does VR work?</h2><p> The basis of a really good VR experience however comes with a headset.</p><p><strong>A VR headset</strong> is a head-mounted display (HMD) that blocks out the outside world and displays a 3-D world or stitched images to create a simulation for the user. VR headsets block out the outside world and present a whole new view for the user. In many cases the screen is set to focus to fill our entire peripheral vision and to block out the outside world. When you put on a professional series VR headset, you should feel like you are in the scene and interacting with it.</p><p><strong>The process of starting up a VR simulation begins with putting on this headset.</strong> Users will usually start up the application or have someone get the game or application going on a PC or console. The VR headset is then plugged in and the user can switch their view over to the headset to immerse themselves in the experience. Once the headset is placed on the user’s head and adjusted to fill their peripheral vision, they can use the motion controls to control the experience on screen or their own body movement to move around the scene. As the user looks around, motion controls in the headset will control the scene as it pans across the screen. As long as the user keeps the headset on, the scene will continue to move and interact with them as they move their head or use the controllers to look around and interact.</p><p> VR technology continues to improve with immersion as well. New headsets, such as the Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR system are available for use in almost anyone’s home. The Oculus Rift is heralded as one of the premier systems for home use and the Samsung Gear VR works with the latest Samsung Galaxy smart phones to turn any smart phone screen into a VR experience. As more competitors continue to develop products it will be interesting to see just how the market evolves and the types of products that are available to users in the near future.</p><h2 id="The-main-features-of-VR-systems-include"><a href="#The-main-features-of-VR-systems-include" class="headerlink" title="The main features of VR systems include"></a>The main features of VR systems include</h2><ul><li><strong>Immersion</strong></li></ul><p> The goal of any VR system is to completely immerse the user in a new simulation environment. This means filling their peripheral vision using the visor, introducing sound canceling surroundsound headphones which can put them into the scene and giving them control over the scene with their head movements. At the very least introducing these three levels of control can create an immersive experience. Adding in new interaction features can be even more powerful.</p><ul><li><strong>Interaction</strong></li></ul><p> In many films and games, app creators are working at creating more immersive experiences. Using a specialty controller in the new Playstation VR for example can help users to interact with the scene and control elements. Having the ability to pick up objects in the scene or even interact with characters can improve immersion even further and add to the value of VR simulations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-webcast-systems-and-applications/"><u>2024 Approved  Premium Webcast Systems & Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-podcast-picks-googlouds-best-series-selection/"><u>2024 Approved  Premium Podcast Picks  GooGloud’s Best Series Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-quality-transformer-for-video-enthusiasts/"><u>2024 Approved  Premium Quality Transformer for Video Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-media-with-extraearsound/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering Media with ExtraEarSound</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-script-craftsmanship-dialogues-that-captivate/"><u>[Updated] Script Craftsmanship  Dialogues That Captivate</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-premium-desktop-systems-unveiled/"><u>In 2024, Premium Desktop Systems Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-m1-innovation-elevating-smoothness-in-every-editors-toolkit/"><u>2024 Approved  M1 Innovation  Elevating Smoothness in Every Editor's Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/mastering-speed-eradicating-background-bgs-in-a-flash-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Speed  Eradicating Background Bgs in a Flash for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastermakers-ranking-the-top-5-digital-titling-pros/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastermakers  Ranking the Top 5 Digital Titling Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/sprint-through-time-uncovering-discarded-reddit-content-for-2024/"><u>Sprint Through Time  Uncovering Discarded Reddit Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-instagram-video-speed-boosting-for-smooth-playbacks-mobiledesktop/"><u>In 2024, Instagram Video Speed Boosting for Smooth Playbacks (Mobile/Desktop)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/unlocking-user-preferences-with-instagrams-real-time-feedback/"><u>Unlocking User Preferences with Instagram's Real-Time Feedback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/discover-how-to-design-dynamic-youtube-music-playlists/"><u>Discover How to Design Dynamic YouTube Music Playlists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-peeksnapper-a-critical-examination-of-micro-recording-tools/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, PeekSnapper  A Critical Examination of Micro-Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-viewer-recognition-the-play-button-reward-ribbon/"><u>[Updated] Viewer Recognition  The Play Button Reward Ribbon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-simplified-systems-for-saving-screen-calls/"><u>[New] Simplified Systems for Saving Screen Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-of-video-brightness-editors-online-and-desktop/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Ultimate List of Video Brightness Editors Online and Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-use-phone-clone-to-migrate-your-oneplus-11r-data-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Use Phone Clone to Migrate Your OnePlus 11R Data? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-capture-every-detail-advanced-skype-calls-recording-methods/"><u>[New] Capture Every Detail  Advanced Skype Calls Recording Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-unmasked-story-watching-a-guide-to-anonymous-instagram-stories-accessibility-pcandroidios/"><u>In 2024, Unmasked Story Watching  A Guide to Anonymous Instagram Stories Accessibility [PC/Android/iOS]</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It is entirely acoustic, with no visual elements. The dialogue, sound effects, and music help the audience understand what is going on. They shape the story by imagining the settings and characters.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Everything-about-Radio-Drama-Scripts"><a href="#Part-1-Everything-about-Radio-Drama-Scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Everything about Radio Drama Scripts"></a>Part 1. Everything about Radio Drama Scripts</h2><p>A radio play script is written in a specific format that allows the playwright to convey how sound and music will be used in the performance. For example, one page of dialogue equals about one minute of airtime. Each scene should be labeled with a number. Normally, lines are double-spaced.</p><h3 id="1-What-are-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#1-What-are-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="1. What are radio drama scripts?"></a>1. What are radio drama scripts?</h3><p>A radio drama is a presentation of a fictional work distributed on the radio. It is completely acoustic with no visual components. The audience understands what is happening through dialogue, sound effects, and music. They give form to the story by visualizing the environment and characters.</p><p>Audio dramas can be works of fiction written expressly for radio broadcasting or podcasting. Alternatively, they can be adapted from plays, novels, short stories, etc.</p><p>Now there is often a need to write audio dramas specifically for radio, as stage plays rely on what the audience can see on stage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-1.jpg"                      alt="radio drama scripts"                ></p><h3 id="2-Elements-of-radio-drama"><a href="#2-Elements-of-radio-drama" class="headerlink" title="2. Elements of radio drama"></a>2. Elements of radio drama</h3><p>Drama’s elements are its fundamental building blocks. The elements of drama are defined as the “key ingredients” of drama in the Arts in New Zealand Curriculum.</p><p>Radio drama contains the same elements as stage drama:</p><ul><li><strong>Role:</strong> characters in the game</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> when the event takes place</li><li><strong>Place:</strong> where the action takes place</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> what happens in the drama?</li><li><strong>Tension:</strong> conflict between characters and their surroundings</li><li><strong>Focus:</strong> the thoughts, feelings, or characters the playwright wants us to focus on at a particular moment.</li></ul><p>In radio drama, however, the playwright must inform us of the elements through various means, because we cannot get the information with our eyes. Radio drama is essentially heard, not seen.</p><h3 id="3-Radio-drama-features"><a href="#3-Radio-drama-features" class="headerlink" title="3. Radio drama features"></a>3. Radio drama features</h3><p><strong>The following are Radio Drama Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Radio drama uses sound to convey ideas to the audience. Audio can be in the form of dialogue, sound effects, or music.</li><li>Actors can play more than one role from moment to moment because only the voice needs to be changed.</li><li>Actors only use voice to express a character. They don’t need to use action, gestures, or facial expressions because the audience can’t see them.</li><li>There is no need for blocking or stage business in radio drama. However, actors may need to plan their movement to and from the microphone.</li><li>Radio playback can be set almost anywhere. There are no physical limits to overcome. Settings can easily be created with music and sound effects.</li><li>Radio drama contains a lot of dialogue. Since we can’t see what the actors are doing, they have to tell us what’s going on. The writer has to find ways for the characters to comment on where they are and what they and others are doing.</li><li>Radio scenes are often shorter than stage plays.</li><li>Radio drama must not be “live” in front of an audience. Radio drama is usually recorded and played back to an audience at a different time. This means that, just like in a movie, scenes don’t have to be played back-to-back and can be played more than once to get the best shot if needed. Drama can also be edited, and audio added.</li><li>Actors do not need to learn their lines. The actors can read their lines from the script because the audience can’t see it. Actors must be familiar with their lines and rehearsed how they will use their voice to tell the audience about the character and the action.</li><li>Radio drama usually features a small cast. A small number of characters are used in each scene because it is too difficult for the audience to distinguish between voices if there are many characters. The audience can also forget that a character is “on stage” if they don’t speak for a while because they can’t be seen. Because of this, the characters must speak quite often and be involved in the plot.</li><li>Radio drama is well suited for monologue and for plays where the setting is limited and physical action is not important, such as in a prison cell or cave.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts"></a>Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts</h2><p>Scriptwriting is a fundamental technique of creativity, whether for content production, copywriting, or art direction. Florida International University offers the Master of Science Creative Track in collaboration with the world-renowned portfolio school Miami Ad School. If you want to become a copywriter, the program is designed to hone your writing skills for a variety of communication styles and media, such as writing for video and audio content, TV and radio commercials, and the web.</p><p>Here are some tips to become a better audio-only content writer.</p><p>Writing a script allows you to control the content, structure, and flow of the program. If the show is unscripted and organic, the host will have talking points for reference. In addition to the script, you can also play with music and sound effects.</p><h3 id="1-Keep-your-scripts-clear"><a href="#1-Keep-your-scripts-clear" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your scripts clear"></a>1. Keep your scripts clear</h3><p>Write the script while keeping it as simple as possible. Don’t fill your sentences with words that don’t add to what you’re trying to say.</p><p>Reading from a script can make you sound a little unnatural, as well as stiff and robotic. That is a huge error. When read aloud, the script should sound natural. A more formal approach and style can result in a show that sounds unnatural and is boring.</p><p>Radio has long been a popular form of entertainment, and radio dramas or plays are an excellent way for writers to express themselves. Original stories or adaptations of novels or plays can be used in radio dramas. Radio plays, like stage plays, have scenes, sequences, and acts, but they are not always structured the same way. Radio drama allows for a great deal of flexibility and creativity, and the medium of sound is also unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-2.jpg"                      alt="keep your scripts clear"                ></p><p>Novelists and screenwriters will need to alter their writing style to write for the ear rather than the eye. Listeners cannot read the previous line or skip ahead. Everything must make sense and be visualized by the listener at that time. To convey action and drama, use dialogue, sound effects, music, and even silence. This can be completed by including specific audio cues in your script so that the show’s creators understand your vision. Keep the script as brief as possible. There can never be too much prose or long-winded dialogue in radio plays. Everything must be brief, succinct, and to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Jump-right-into-the-action"><a href="#2-Jump-right-into-the-action" class="headerlink" title="2. Jump right into the action"></a>2. Jump right into the action</h3><p>Radio drama can be more difficult because it must immediately engage listeners, or they will lose interest and switch stations or channels. The first two minutes are crucial, so start your drama at the appropriate point in the story. The rule of thumb in the radio industry is ‘arrive late, leave early.’ This means you should enter the story at a later stage when the action has begun or when a crisis has occurred. Unlike books and movies, setting, building, and background details are not required. You can save the necessary details for later in the play.</p><p>Radio scripts, like scripts, must conform to industry standards for radio program producers to find the script usable. Include scripts for music, sound effects, silence, dialogue, and other audio needs in the game so that producers can see how the script will translate into the show. Include information for the actors as well, so they can bring your vision to life. For example, use adjectives to describe how they should sound when reading their lines - sad, angry, laughing, and so on. Also, keep the number of characters to a minimum and give each one a distinct voice and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-3.jpg"                      alt="jump right into the action"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational"><a href="#3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational" class="headerlink" title="3. Make It Sound Conversational"></a>3. Make It Sound Conversational</h3><p>Whether fully scripted or not, audio programs are at their best when they sound natural. Make sure your grammar is concise and to the point so that you can improvise and expand on what you’ve written.</p><p>Write like you talk. A well-written script, read word for word, should be invisible to the listener. Your script must sound natural and relaxed. Read the script out loud or have someone read it.</p><p>Can’t find people ready to help? No problem, paste the script into your text-to-speech program. Wondershare Filmora has a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >text-to-speech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>(TTS) feature. If you’re gasping in the middle of a sentence, shorten your sentences.</p><p>If the words are too difficult to express well or the meaning might be lost on the listener, try to use simple words whenever possible. Also, use free online tools like Hemingway Editor to help you identify complex sentences.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Some-famous-radio-dramas"><a href="#Part-3-Some-famous-radio-dramas" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Surely, playing PUBG on your mobile is fun and it is also more simple, but there is a limit that you can’t do on your mobile. When you are gaming, the flexibility of the keyboard and mouse are the best things ever. Then, can you play PUBG mobile on your PC or laptop?</p><p>In this part, I will let you know how you play PUBG on a PC and how to connect with a PC voice changer. Tencent just launched its official PUBG Mobile emulator which enables you to play it even on a PC or a laptop. For those who want to have flexibility without limitation, you better watch the steps on how you play PUBG mobile on your PC below:</p><p>Step1 Download and install the Tencent Gaming Buddy emulator</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-6.jpg"                      alt="click download"                ></p><p>Download Tencent Buddy Emulator, then run the software and it will download the required files automatically. It takes about 10-15 minutes to install it.</p><p>Step2 Download the additional files</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-7.jpg"                      alt="download additional files"                ></p><p>When the emulator is installed, launch the game. It will download some necessary files required to launch the game. Make sure you have good internet connectivity since these files are large.</p><p>Step3 Get your chicken dinner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-8.jpg"                      alt="you are done"                ></p><p>When finish downloading all the additional files, log in with your credentials to import all your mobile PUBG stats. All the controls are in a tab towards the right side of the screen, enter full-screen mode by pressing F11. Since PUBG servers detect emulators, you and your friends will only be paired with other players running this emulator.</p><p>Then, you may ask, “How do I connect with a PC voice changer?” No worries, I will let you know too. For your information, free voice changers are much easier to find on PC. There are some good voice changers for PUBG such as Clownfish, Voicemod, and MorphVOX. I will give you the steps to connect with Clownfish in PUBG:</p><p>Step1 Download and launch Clownfish</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-9.jpg"                      alt="set voice changer"                ></p><p>Download the software, then launch it. After that select “Set Voice Changer” and select any desired sound effects.</p><p>Step2 Click on “Hear Microphone”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-10.jpg"                      alt="hear the voice effects"                ></p><p>Click on “Hear Microphone” and hear the voice effects. Turn that off when you have chosen your favorite effect and you are done.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone"><a href="#Part-3-Method-3-Buy-a-hardware-voice-changer-to-connect-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone"></a>Part 3: Method 3: Buy a hardware voice changer to connect your phone</h2><p>After you know the voice changer on your phone and your PC for PUBG, what is another alternative you can do to change your voice in PUBG? Well, eventually you can also use a hardware voice changer and connect it to your phone. When you use hardware, the result should be in real-time, which is less than a 30ms delay, while it takes a longer delay when you use the software.</p><p>There are some hardware voice changers out there. For the hardware, I recommend you try TC Helicon VoiceLive Play. The TC Helicon VoiceLive Play is such a great vocal effects unit. It is simple, has a user-friendly layout, and has a small footprint. Around the LCD Display, there are six buttons. They are labeled and work dependent on context when you’re in the menus on the VoiceLive Play.</p><p>Their base functions are Genre, Setup, Effects, Favorite, Practice, and Mix (to adjust the output levels, USB input level, and the level for the in-built mic). These controls have context-dependent functions. To navigate the menus and adjust selected parameters, just simply use the left-right arrow buttons and the control dial below. There are also Back and Store buttons on either side of these. You use these to step back a menu level and save any changes that you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-you-voice-in-pubg-11.jpg"                      alt="voicelive play"                ></p><p>Compared to the VoiceLive 3 and the VoiceLive 3 Extreme’s menus, the 32-page guide to the VoiceLive Play tells you that the pedal is so simple to get to grips with. The menu system and layout of the VoiceLive Play make it easy to access any features that you want. There is a feature that will give you the tools you need to produce pretty much any vocal effect you want.</p><p>The effects groups include harmonies, reverbs, delays, transducers HardTune, doubling, harmony effects, and μmod, which is TC Helicon’s name for chorus, flangers, and similar effects. The sounds are generally good, too. For the price, the TC Helicon VoiceLive costs $ 279. Overall, once you finish setting up gotten your sounds, it’s really easy to incorporate the VoiceLive and you can have a hardware voice changer for PUBG.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-edit-the-voice-in-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?"></a>Part 4: How to edit the voice in a video with Filmora?</h2><p>Besides those mentioned above, do you know that you can also edit the video with Filmora?
